And  basically all that really matters is this token id. This token ID is actually codifying the genes of the tree. And then there is the on-chain JavaScript that takes the token ID, translate it into a set of genes, and then renders them visually."

You know, with art blocks, you usually have this problem of like, how do you interface between the blockchain data and the rendering of that data off-chain? Because you need something that can read the blockchain. With Arborithms, you don't need to read the blockchain, you just need to receive the token id, which all those NFT platforms import directly. And the token ID contains everything, right? And so then what the javascript do is just translating the token id into the specific genes of that Arborithm, and just render them."

And so, for instance, you can load different trees and you're like, okay, this one is quite funky. You like it, because it has really cool little leaves. This one is actually not too bad, right? And so you can check how will they look like if they were to reproduce, how will the child look like?"

So it's taking some of the genes from this one and some of the genes from that one. Like the child might have taken the shape of the trunk from one parent, but then it has taken the style of the leaf from the other parent, or whatever. So eventually you can try, you know, this is nice, but maybe you like another one, you love another one, and then if you like it, you can reproduce them. And when you reproduce them, you're minting this new one."

          "content": "Exactly. The cost of minting a new one is the basic fee of making a new tree, plus the fee of that you have to give to the two parents that you're breeding from. So for instance, this one, they all start at 0.01 and then every time it is used for a reproduction, the fee increase. So then it's 0.02, 0.03 etc. So the trees that have been reproduced a lot becomes very expensive to reproduce more, whereas the tree that never been reproduced are very cheap."

But then many people will try to get the same foliage, which is quite hard because you don't just take the foliage, you have to find the right breed to make something similar.

And then of course, after this one has been reproduced hundreds of times, no one wants to reproduce it anymore, it's too expensive. And so they will look for the other trees to reproduce so that enable the spreading of the species."
