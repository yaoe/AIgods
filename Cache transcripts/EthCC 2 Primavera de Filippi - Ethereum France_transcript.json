And so most of the book is looking at how do we actually what is the interplay between the rule of law and the rule of code."

        "content": "to try and understand how the legal system can actually look at this technology, let's look at like, what are those unique characteristics of blockchain technologies that actually distinguish itself from traditional code? So, well, the first one is a blockchain is a decentralized database that operates on a peer to peer network. And just like the Internet, a blockchain is a transnational network that of course, do not account for national boundaries. And because a blockchain is replicated on the node of every computer in the network, it is also highly resilient. And because all those nodes follow the exact same protocol, then it is almost impossible to unilaterally change or tamper with the data that is stored on this decentralized database."

And then because every transaction is cryptographically signed by the key of the party executing it, then one cannot later deny having executed a specific transaction. And then most blockchain are also inherently pseudonymous, at least in the case of public blockchain. And this means that people do not need to identify themselves in order to participate into the network, and they just need to create an account in order to obtain an address that will then identify them in a pseudonymous manner. And then finally, and most importantly, then we have those blockchains that make it possible not only to record information, but also to store and to execute software code that will run with a guarantee of execution, in the sense that no one can unilaterally modify, influence, or stop the execution of that software."

And so on the Internet back in the 90s, then, when people started reflecting about what kind of regulation could apply or could not apply to Internet code, then we had this notion of lex informatica, which essentially reflected the idea that on the Internet, code is increasingly assuming the functionality the same function of law, in the sense that private actors are actually using their own pieces of code in order to regulate behavior. And so to some extent, code becomes the law of the Internet."

The the difference is that this time, given the specificity of blockchain code, then it can be used to actually create those form of smart, contract and self executed code based rule, which to some extent will and can ignore the traditional rule of the law. And so the only law that actually matters in the context of a blockchain based system, it's the code."

And so this means that as long as people can actually trust the technology, then they no longer need to trust anyone else. And the other one is that it creates increasing opportunity for automation and autonomy of those code based system, because once they have been deployed on the blockchain, then they no longer need to obey or listen to the rules, even of the operator that have actually deployed this code. And so the system can actually be designed to operate autonomously and independently of the will of the party who have initially deployed them."

But of course, over time, we realized that those visions, those ideas, did not actually materialize in the same way as many of us would have hoped. And as soon as the opportunities of the Internet and the commercial interest actually became to be understood by new and established market players, then the network architecture actually started to change and slowly turn into a more and more concentrated system which is today controlled by a few incumbents."

And so if I've acquired a particular piece of property in a way that turns out to be illegitimate, then a court order or a judge can actually declare that I am not the legitimate owner of that property and potentially seize it from me. And when we move into a blockchain based system, then we have this concept of cryptographic assets or blockchain based property that actually do not follow the same rules. And so the ownership of those assets is not defined by the law, but rather by the code. And therefore it can only be taken away by the code. And so if I illegitimately acquire a Bitcoin, then regardless of what the law says, then no one has the ability to unilaterally seize that asset unless the code specifically provide for that."

Traditional legal contracts are created according to specific rules which are defined in contract law and which are meant to create some kind of binding agreements between parties. But those contracts need the intervention of a third party authority that needs to interpret the wording of those contracts in order to understand what is the actual meaning of the parties. And this is what will actually be enforced by the law. And when we move again into blockchain based system, then with the smart contract, we have contractual relationships which are actually defined by code rather by the law. And of course this does not really account for the real intention of the parties, but only account for the wordings of the code. And the benefit of course, is that those systems do not actually require any third party enforcement, because the provision of the Smart Contract will be automatically enforced through the technology itself."

And the main challenge here was that regardless of what legal system, what a judge will actually say, regardless of the ultimate decision, if there had been a dispute, then because there was no centralized authority, then the only way to actually act and remediate on this issue was through affecting the actual code of the Smart Contract or the underlying protocol. And so this of course raised these very interesting debates within the Ethereum community whether or not this act qualified as a theft in the sense that it actually went counter to the original intentions of the parties, or whether it could be regarded as some kind of legitimate action, because it did not actually go counter the actual wording of, of the Smart Contract."

And so the only way to actually remediate the thought was to address the code level of the problem, which is taking a coordinated action in order to change the underlying code of the Ethereum blockchain."

For instance, by applying some form of packet filtering technique are other ways to actually limit or slow down access to a blockchain based network. And then we also have the traditional informediaries which are actually providing access or helping us find the right infrastructure. And those could actually also be used to limit the adoption of those technologies by making them harder to find.

And of course we are seeing this with all the know your customer and anti money laundering interventions. And then we have the mining pool or the miners and the transaction processor. And we have seen that in the last few years there has been a growing consolidation of the system into a few large mining pools which have become identifiable intermediaries which can also be regulated by the country in which they exist. And we have seen both in the US and in China, we are seeing some, some initial form of intervention where some states in, in the US are starting to increase taxes for mining pool or perhaps reducing the amount of electricity that they will actually let use, for instance in, in Washington State."

And secondly, as it has been shown in the past, it is usually a very bad idea to actually target end users, as we've seen with the case of copyright law, for instance, with the war against piracy, because this might actually justify very draconian regulations which are actually intended against the end user, but eventually actually affect the whole population of the Internet."

And the idea is that if we can control, we don't actually need to take over the whole network. We just need to have exercise control on the super nodes. And then automatically, if a particular exchange, like if Coinbase or Kraken or Blockchain Explorer are adopting a particular fork of a blockchain, then automatically most of the users that depend on the services will also follow that fork. So those, those operators, even though they don't have the actual power, technical power to actually affect, decide or take over the network, they actually have extreme influence to dictate which one of the forks will be used."

And we have seen the importance that social norms can play in the operation of a blockchain. When we compare especially for instance, the social norms of the BITCOIN network, which has this collective desire of actually achieving near perfect immutability. So the notion of code is low, as opposed to Ethereum, which actually focus perhaps more on the notion of distributed consensus rather than code is low.

And then eventually it became obvious that the governance by the infrastructure is not sufficient.
