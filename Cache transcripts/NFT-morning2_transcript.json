There was Luc Jeudet too who came from NFT Factory. Then there was Operator, there was Sam Jansen, Sam Jay, So they're more performance artists, but who work heavily in NFTs. So actually, there was kind of this idea of... There was TerraZero too, Sacha Styles, Milos Manetas, etc."

But the idea was really to focus on, while the subject was the metaverse, actually we wanted to focus heavily on interdisciplinarity, and so to have artists who do a bit of everything from poets, musicians, dancers, and visual arts, to precisely explore this concept of the metaverse, in a way that's not only in the sense of the metaverse, purely digital, but really the metaverse which is kind of this intersection between the physical world, the virtual world, and which will create bridges between these different physical and virtual universes. It was very interdisciplinary. and it was quite cool because precisely, the idea of Glitch is that normally, maximum, you have 35 at the same time. So, you have 35 people who really come from different disciplines, but who are still very aligned in terms of values and trajectory, towards what society do we want to go. And actually, who live for two weeks under the roof of a very beautiful castle in Burgundy. And actually, there's not really a program, that is to say there's no structure, there are no talks, etc., that are pre-programmed. But it's only a program that is co-created by the participants. And the goal is really serenity, cross-pollination and collaborations that will be created as people meet."

        "content": "So, there are several projects that are emerging from all this, which is kind of the goal. There's a project that's quite fascinating, it's the cube. So, actually, during Glitch, there's a small group of artists who got together and who wanted to offer the metaverse to the physical world and so who created a cube, a cube of I think 3 meters by 3 meters, covered with canvases and with a series of 5 projectors that project onto the canvases of this cube. so that there were people inside who were walking around in the metaverse and it projected what they saw onto the canvas of the cube and you could enter the cube and you were in the metaverse and you could interact. There were people who embodied themselves in the metaverse and who allowed this kind of interaction with physical people and digital people. And so there, this project which apparently is becoming... It was a prototype, it was done a bit hastily, of course. But now, the cube which is becoming a real project, which will reproduce itself and so with NFT elements that will be integrated. Then, there's a very cool project too, which wasn't born there, but which grew there. It's the Aminals project. And the Aminals, actually, once again, it's another typology of blockchain-based life forms, but this time which is purely digital. And the Aminals, so they're little aminals, but they're aminals, which are creatures on the blockchain and which are NFTs, but which are NFTs that you can't own. Actually, the idea was, but what is a purely digital creature on the blockchain? And actually, we don't really want people to own the creatures and speculate on the value of the creatures. And so actually, we conceptualized this whole model where the aminals are NFTs that you don't own but that you can interact with and that can attach to you. And when you can feed them, so actually it's kind of a crypto black hole, you can feed them, you can play with them, etc. It always involves giving them crypto. So they accumulate lots of crypto. For example, if they're hungry and you feed them, they'll attach to you. If they feel lonely and you go play with them, they'll also attach. And when they attach to you, you can ask them to move in the metaverse, to move to coordinates that you desire, so they can follow you, or you can tell them to move X, Y, and then you have the possibility, when they're very very very attached to you, you have the possibility to genetically modify them, and so to inject new genes into these aminals, And then the aminals can reproduce with each other, and when they reproduce, they integrate the genes. And so if your gene has been reproduced, when a new aminal is generated, all the people who participated in creating the genes of a new aminal will actually receive a portion of all the crypto that the aminals have collected so far. And so the goal is to have aminals that are your friends. And so instead of... In your wallet, you can show not only the NFTs that you own because you bought them on the market, but you can also show the aminals that love you and so the aminals that are close to you. But actually, you have no exclusivity over these aminals, that is to say that if someone else goes to feed them or take care of them, suddenly, they'll start sharing their affection between several actors. And so, actually, it's a different model of showing, listen, I have this affection."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "No, not at all, but it's another model. Because actually, the only way you'll get money back from the aminals is that you contributed to their genetic evolution and they reproduced and your gene was selected. So it's a bit more complicated to get rich than through a liquidity pool, but also it's a liquidity pool that reproduces. And so actually if you found this gene which is an absolutely popular gene and actually all the aminals reproduce and everyone sees this little gene, Actually, there, you can make a lot, a lot of money, but on the other hand, it's very possible too that you spent several tens or hundreds of ETH feeding your aminals, but actually, you'll never receive anything."

        "content": "Listen, it's a collaboration, so it was mainly me, Lewis Parker, Isaac Padka and Will Paper. It was kind of a four-way collaboration, but well, it was mainly a project. We discussed it all together at Glitch, everyone gave feedback, etc. And so there, we're going to implement it soon. So, it's super interesting. And then, another quite interesting project that came out was this kind of art protocol, where actually, what we want to do is... So there, we're going to organize a festival. Well, we're going to participate in a festival, notably at Château du Fé, next September. and there will be a whole Glitch chapter at the festival. And the idea is that actually, we want to create works that are protocolar, that is to say that actually, they feed on data from other works and they provide data for other works. That is to say that actually, there's this kind, we're creating this protocol, so a smart contract, that each work that wants to plug into the Glitch protocol will be able to integrate, whether it's a digital work or a physical work. For example, in the case of the plantoid, the plantoid that will collect data to create NFTs, it will also record this data on a smart contract that's part of the Glitch protocol. That means that suddenly, if you want to create another work, which can be a digital work or not, you're going to create an NFT, you can choose that the NFT will plug into the plantoid's data. And so, actually, the plantoid becomes the input for the generation of an NFT, or vice versa, the plantoid could decide that actually, it's going to listen to information from a performance that's done by other artists, who are also plugged into the Glitch protocol. And so, the NFTs that it will generate are informed by the data that comes out of another work. And the idea is to create this new concept of collective work, but collective work not because everyone works on the same work, but because actually it's kind of plug and play, it's composability, it's works that feed each other with data, and since most of these works are based on a form of generative art, the instantiation or manifestation of these works depends on the manifestation of another work that has plugged into the same protocol. And the idea is that precisely, it allows you to make glitches, since if I know that I have another work that relies on my data, on the data from my work to manifest itself, I can try to make it glitch. And so actually, since they're all connected, interconnected and dependent on each other, you can play on affecting another person's works, either in a standardized way, in an expected way, or in an unexpected way. And so, when you connect to the glitch protocol, it means you never know when your work will glitch, because someone will try to, not hack, but circumvent the data a bit to see what it gives in another work."

It was really an incredible atmosphere. I really loved it. I had a great time. I met lots of incredible artists. It opened my eyes to lots of things. Yeah, and then...

I don't know if that's well summarized."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yes, actually the idea, I call it a new artistic movement, but actually it's very present notably in AI. That is to say that when you're an AI artist, what do you do? You're going to create a protocol and then you give the protocol to a model or to an AI and the AI will generate works based on this protocol. But actually, you are the artist of the protocol and so you are the artist of the result. And actually it applies easily, it's easily observed in the world of AI, but actually it applies perfectly also in any other domain. And so notably for example the plantoid, it's a protocol, that is to say that I created the plantoid protocol, when then there's another artist who will create a new sculpture because they were hired by a plantoid, they are actually creating a plantoid and so they are creating my work. And the idea of protocalism is precisely the goal, whereas with usual copyright, the reproduction of a work is a copyright violation that will encroach on the interests of the artist. In the case of protocalism, the reproduction of the work, actually, is production. That is to say that actually I need people to reproduce my work as a protocalist because they are producing new works, even if it's them who produce them. In reality, each of these productions and reproductions embodies the artist's protocol and so actually each work instantiated either by a machine, or by an AI, or by a human, will contribute to increasing the quantity of works that the protocalist artist has generated without them having to work. And so the idea is also to go into this new creative process where actually you invent The protocol, actually Sol LeWitt, I think is perhaps the most telling example of one of the very early protocalists, where precisely you give instructions and then people will create by following the instructions. But the creation, the artistic and creative work, It's a collaboration, so there's always the protocalist who invented, who created the protocol, who is therefore the artist of all the works that embody this protocol. And then, each person who will instantiate the protocol is also an artist, because they have the choice of how to instantiate. So there's also a form of artistic discretionary capacity. And so each work is a collective work between the person who created the work and the protocalist."

After that it raises questions of intellectual property rights and obviously Primavera is aware. But I find that in the approach, it's super interesting to formalize this thing, which actually has always existed. I think Primavera, you agree, there have always been artists who were protocalists, but who then produced themselves on their own protocol. But there, the fact of giving this quality to the person who invented this protocol, it brings something."

I see it once again as today, we spend our time already relying on, borrowing from others. And so, it's simply assuming it a bit more and putting it at the heart of the reflection, quite simply."

The agent works for you because people who find your protocol interesting and who decide to instantiate it in their own works, actually, they work for you and you don't need to hire assistants. You have people who, for their own pleasure and for their own benefits too, they think this protocol will contribute to their own work and so they create a work with your protocol.

It's kind of my mission, there, it's to try to... to communicate this new concept of protocalism as an artistic movement so that all protocalist artists, actually, it resonates immediately. There was notably Fernando Haglich. He doesn't stop, he said, but it completely... I discovered being a protocalist and suddenly, all his work makes so much more sense. So actually, I think artists who are protocalists, the moment they hear the description, the explanation of this concept, they recognize themselves immediately. And it's just that they didn't know they were part of the same movement, because often, they're artists from very different disciplines, etc. And I find it super interesting to launch the idea of this movement in the air and then to allow artists with whom it resonates to group around this concept. And once the movement is not formed, because you don't form a movement, once the movement is recognized, suddenly it also allows inspiring other artists who perhaps are not yet in the protocalism approach, to experiment with these modalities."

It's something that interests me a lot, notably at the factory, we're a physical place but we're thinking about the metaverse. And there we're really at the crossroads of both, with physical interactions, with people who on one side evolve in the metaverse, who have avatars, who are quote unquote visualizations of their avatars in a 3D world, and people who physically are immersed in screens and who can interact with these avatars. It's a bit of a meeting between the physical person and another person's avatar. It's a bit this dream, this theme that we often see with the Avatar film for example. It's a bit of a generic theme right now. And so there, there's the artistic version and the version that we can experiment with, so I was really impressed by this project. There you go, then beyond that, this Glitch residency, it's incredible for inspiring, it's incredible for meeting, it's incredible for discussing, there's a philosophical aspect that's very important.

And so all the artists who participated in Glitch in the past two years, we're going to invite them to create works for the festival, potentially works that will stay there, that will stay at the castle. and the idea is that all the works that will be in the festival must be part of the Glitch protocol, so they'll all be interconnected."
