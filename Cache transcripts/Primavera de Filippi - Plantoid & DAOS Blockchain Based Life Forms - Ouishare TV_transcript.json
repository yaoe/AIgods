And in order to illustrate this concept, I will use the example of the plantoid, which is an experiment that I started over one year ago in order to use artistic practice in order to explain exactly this revolutionary aspect of the blockchain."

        "content": "what is a plantoid? Well, you have one right here, which I will activate soon. But essentially, a plantoid is to a plant what an Android is to a human. It is a mechanical electromechanical structure that replicates the characteristics of a plant. But there is one important distinction between a plantoid and a plant, and this is in the way in which they reproduce. So most plants actually are not able to reproduce themselves on their own, and they require the help of bees or butterflies in order to help them through the pollination process. Now, plantoids do not actually require pollination, but they rely on the process of capitalization. And for this, they do actually need the help of human beings in order to help them accumulate the funds necessary to reproduce."

One is the body, the mechanical structure, and the other one is the soul or the spirit of the plantoid, which subsists as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. And those two components interact with one another in order to actually ensure that the plantoid can reproduce itself."

The first step is the capitalization process, which is where the plantoid will actually beg human beings to give it some money in order to be able to reproduce it. So I will now do a demonstration. I will feed this plantoid with some bitcoins, and hopefully it's going to be thankful for that. It will take a little bit, but the way it works is basically that the plantoid comes with its own bitcoin wallet, and it's constantly monitoring the balance of its own account. And at some point it realized that it has accumulated a sufficient amount of funds in order to reproduce itself."

And this is where the planet will actually look for human beings who are willing to help it reproduce itself. And the way this works is that the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain will Open a call for submission, inviting people to submit proposals as to how they envision the next version of the pointoid to look like. And then everyone, everyone who actually has funded the point initially, can then express his voice as to which one they think is the proposal that should be selected by sending a microtransaction to the bitcoin address, which uniquely identifies those proposals. And then this vote is weighted by the amount of bitcoins that everyone has sent to the original plantoid. And the SMART contract is then processing all this information and will identify who the winner is."

And this is done by the plaintoid signing a bitcoin transaction together in collaboration with the original artist that created it, which also hold a signature on this account, in order to transfer the funds that have been accumulated to a new artist, which will then be in charge of creating the new plantoid."

And the thing is that whenever the plantoid accumulates sufficient amount of funds to reproduce itself, it will send a small portion of this fence back to its parents, to the plantoid that generated it, and also a small royalties to the artist that actually made the plantoid. And this means that now every artist has actually a really strong incentive to create a really beautiful plantoid, but also to maximize the visibility of this plantoid, and to actually encourage the remix and the making of derivative works of the plantoid."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "this obviously clashes a little bit with the traditional conception of copyright law, which is based on the notion of scarcity and exclusivity. But most importantly, it actually shifted the model around, because instead of funding an artist with the expectation that these artists will create new works that we might like, we can now fund directly the art piece itself, which will then be in charge of selecting and then hiring the artist that the plantoid has decided should reproduce. And so, in some way, this is actually the extreme model of the open source logic, where the art piece actually acquires a life on its own and is able to evolve independently of the will of the original author. And so, in some way, this can be regarded as an evolutionary algorithm, as the plantoid evolves and expand into multiple branches or species, and. And the popularity of which will depend ultimately on how popular and how beautiful the planetoid, according to the environment in which it sits."

Because it fulfilled the three core characteristics of being autonomous, self sufficient, and most importantly, it is capable of reproducing itself. But the Blindhead is actually just one example of a much more generic concept of decentralized autonomous organization, where in this specific case, the mission of the organization is actually to reproduce itself in the form of a plant."

        "content": "the Plantoid is actually not the only one of its kind. And in fact, recently, about two weeks ago, a new decentralized autonomous organization is built. And its name is the dao. And it is actually quite impressive in that it has managed to raise over $120 million in just two weeks of its existence. And the way the DAO works is actually quite similar to the way in which the Plantoid works, only that it provides a much more generic framework for decentralized organizations. So people can send funds to the DAO and then they will receive some tokens in exchange, and those tokens will enable them to participate into the governance of the organization. And then anyone can submit a proposal as to how they envision those funds to be spent. And then all the token holders can then express their voice as to whether they think that this proposal should be funded or not."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "again, we can see that even though it does not actually have a physical embodiment,  the DAO actually also qualifies as blockchain based life forms in that it is autonomous. As a leaderless organization that is actually regulated only through its code. It is also self sufficient because it is able to collect funds in order to actually ensure the ability to operate over time. And of course, it is also capable of reproducing itself, because the model of the DAO can actually be taken and modified and forked in in order to actually give life to a whole new variety of decentralized autonomous organizations."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "if we look at the way in which the DAO has been implemented, even though it is actually quite revolutionary in that it relies on this trustless and decentralized infrastructure that enable it to be autonomous. If we look at the governance model of the dao, it's actually quite traditional that it relies on a set of shareholder or in this case, token holders which actually can engage into the governance, and then a few number of elected board members which have this special power of approving or vetoing the funding of a proposal. And so this is important because it actually show that there is a really important gap in that we do now have this really powerful decentralized infrastructure, but we still do not really have figured out a decentralized governance structure that we could plug on top of this. And of course, it is always possible to plug a centralized model on top of a decentralized infrastructure. But then to some extent, we actually cannot enjoy the full benefits of decentralization. And then the closest thing that we have to a decentralized governance model is actually the free market. But as we all know, the market can actually quite easily be manipulated by powerful actors, and and it might not always lead to the most effective outcome for a democratic society."

        "content": "this brings back to this question as to whether the blockchain can actually provide the necessary infrastructure in order to enable a real collaborative economy by eliminating the figure of the middleman or the intermediary and enabling people to cooperate in a much more decentralized manner. But if we look at most of the real world applications of the blockchain today, we can see that they are actually promoting quite an individualistic approach to collaboration as they create this trustless infrastructure that enable people to interact with each other even when they do not know each other, and without the need of actually trusting each other and engaging into any kind of social relationship. And this is actually quite different from from the original conception of the collaborative or the sharing economy. And indeed, the prospect of living in a purely trustless society, which is regulated by code and where people interact with one another mediated through this trustless technology, is perhaps not the most appealing one."

        "content": "It is always possible to plug on top of this trustless infrastructure a new layer of trust, or a trust protocol that will enable people to collaborate and to actually engage into trusted interaction while maintaining the benefits of decentralization. And so this is what actually motivated me to work on buckfeed, which is building a decentralized value distribution and reputation system that can be used as a distributed governance model for decentralized organizations. And the idea with Backfeed is to move away from this notion of distributed autonomous organization, which are designed around the concepts of automation, optimization and trustless interaction, and to move instead forward the notion of decentralized collaborative organization that promotes a more cooperative approach and enable people to co create and to actually engage in social cohesion."

But it is then up to us now to decide whether we can use those tools in order to implement a completely trustless society, or whether we can actually implement a smart social contract to actually enable a true collaborative economy. Thank you. And by the way, if you do have some bitcoins or some ether that you don't know what to do with, I invite you to send them to the Plantoid and she will show some form of appreciation for that."
