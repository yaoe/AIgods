And so we have seen this with the invention of the steam engine, the printing press, the advent of electricity, and then more recently, with the deployment of those modern communication networks, such as the radio, the television, and, of course, the Internet network. And every one of those innovations has actually contributed to significant economic growth and has enabled the flourishing of many new industries, which often have happened at the expenses of a few established players that simply did not manage to adjust to the rapid changes of society."

And this is important because it means that it is extremely difficult to shut down this network because there is no single point of failure."

And some people even went as far as saying that the cyberspace was an independent space that simply could not be regulated, and that governments simply did not have the right nor the authority to actually exert their sovereignty over it."
