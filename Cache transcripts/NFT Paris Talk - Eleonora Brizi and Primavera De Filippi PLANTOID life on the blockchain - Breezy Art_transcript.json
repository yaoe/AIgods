        "content": "Okay. Hello everyone. Welcome to the self managed stage. So I'm going to introduce. I'm going to do the introduction as well. Thank you for being here. It's very nice to be at NFT Paris again. My name is Eleonora Brizzi and I am a permissionless art curator. And I am here today with Primavera Di Filippi, who is an amazing human being and artist, creator, researcher, blockchain expert and much more. And especially one of the biggest innovators in the space. And you know, there is a difference. I would like to mention my friend Bea, who is the co founder of Dada and the other co founder is here, Julia Judy, who always says that there is a difference between being innovators and being early in things. And Primavera is an innovator and so she's not just early with her art and her research. And today we have with us the very beautiful Plantoids. There is one plantoid here and they're all invited to come to visit our booth, which is the number 42, where there is magic interaction and group of plantoids speaking to each other and speaking to you that you can experience. I will leave Primavera talk about the Plantoids. But before that I just wanted to tell you that this creatures, as I call creatures of wonder, they're very special. And it's not only about the technology that is behind them and how they exist. But I believe that every work of art obviously is a creation. So it comes from something that wasn't existing before and that it's injected into the world obviously by artists. So of course it's always something living and alive and pieces of life. But the Plantoids are very special because they are life forms for real and only they live on the blockchain. So it is a very exciting interaction that you can have with these creatures. And also the manifestation of how, as I was saying yesterday, life always find its way. And it's very crazy and fantastic to understand that it also found its way in the blockchain. I will leave the word to Primavera, who now will talk to you about the plantoids. And then we can also show you how the plantoid works."

It needs to be self sufficient in the sense that it is capable to interact with the environment in order to actually collect all the resources necessary for itself, survival and sustenance. And then like every life forms, it also need to have like adaptability and evolutionary traits, meaning that it needs to be able to adapt to the environment, which implies some form of either mutability or reproducibility so that this species can actually evolve and sustain itself over time."

And then they also can generate seeds that will help them reproduce. And so they try to attract humans, and they invite them to provide some crypto to them. And in exchange of this, the humans will be able to collect a particular NFTs that will be generated by the plantoid."

And then you can interact with the plantoid, whether you can speak to it, or you can touch it, or you can activate it through sensors. And these feed into either a generative art algorithm or into generative AI. And so you are co creating along with the plantoid, an art piece. And then this art piece will be then minted as an NFT and then given back to you as a seed, the digital seed of the plantoid that you have collected."

So it creates a symbiotic relationship in which humans are incentivized to feed the plantoid in order to collect the seed and then speculate on the seed. But the more you speculate on the seed, the more you're actually giving the royalties to the plantoid. And so the more you continue to help it in the reproduction process."

So Plantoid 1 was created in 2014, and it was a very basic bitcoin plant, but then it has evolved and then it moved into Ethereum and then it started making NFTs. So here you can see this one is Plantoid 14. And so basically they keep reproducing themselves and they try to identify what is the next evolutionary trait that will make them more fit for the environment."

And so over the years, then when NFT became very popular, then the Plantoids realized, well, actually, if I start making nft, I might get even more money and I will be able to reproduce myself more. And so eventually there is this evolutionary digital Darwinism that emerges. And then the plantoid species is evolving based on what the market environment looks like."

        "content": "the reason that this is a positive pyramid scheme is because this actually creates an incentive for the artist to try and create the most beautiful plantoid and to also incentivize the making of derivative, because the more the plantoid will reproduce, then the more royalties will come back to the original artist."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Most importantly, perhaps this actually flips completely copyright on its head. Not only because instead of trying to maximize exclusivity and prevent anyone from looking at the work, except if they pay, in the case of Plantoid, you want to maximize the visibility of the work in order to help it collect more funds. You also want to maximize the reproduction and the creation of derivative works, because that will give royalties."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "most importantly, it's changed the model in which instead of giving money to an artist and hoping that the artist will somehow continue to make works that we enjoy, we now can feed the artwork itself. The fund goes to the artwork, and then it is the artwork through its own government structure that will elect who is the artist. Who is the next artist that is invited to actually create a new copy of the work. I will stop here because this is something else. Yes."

        "role": "user",
        "content": "Okay. So you understand that this is just an artwork. This is a whole universe that she created. So what I want to ask you, which I always wanted to. This is a real question to. So you created as an Artist, you almost created another artist. Because I understand that the Plantoid is an artwork, but being autonomous and acting the way it's acting, it's also creating its own artworks based on interactions that human beings have with it. And I find it very special for an artist almost night not want to be at the center of the creation. It's almost like you're taking yourself a little bit out of the creation to give more importance to the creation itself to keep creating. So I wanted to ask you how at the beginning you came out with Plantoids and why. But also, I think that you made something very special and you took a very strong position for which it's the removal of the artist from the art a little bit."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah. So the original intention for creating Planetoid is that as a researcher, I've been investigating the legal challenges of Blockchain technologies, and I was doing that in, like, 2013, et cetera. And as I was explaining, there is, like, daos that are coming up, and then smart contract. And then what does it mean when you're interacting with a smart contract? Is there really a legal contract? And et cetera. And so, and I was talking with, like, academics and lawyers, and everyone was like, you're just talking science fiction. Because at the time, there was very little daos and smart contracts."

        "content": "I realized that the only way to actually convey that it is not science fiction, that it's actually there, is to actually make one. But of course, it doesn't make any sense. At the time, it didn't make any sense to do anything except as an artistic practice. And so Plantoid was created in order to as it was an attempt of illustrating as many of the legal challenges as possible into one single art piece."

        "content": "basically the idea being like, well, first of all, what does it mean when you send crypto to the Plantoid, who actually detains those crypto? Because Plantoid doesn't have a legal personality. What happens when the Plantoid is hiring an artist to create a new replica of itself? Is there an actual legal relationship? Is there a contract, even though one of the two parties doesn't have legal capacity? What happens if a person has been hired by Plantoid to create a new replica and it actually he doesn't fulfill the contract? Who can sue and on behalf of whom? And all those questions, right?"

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "then, of course, also the question of like, as a copyright scholar, of, like, illustrating the fact that what does it mean when you actually pay the artwork instead of paying the artist? And what happened when the artwork itself is creating a new Art piece. Who is the copyright holder of the piece that was generated by the Plantoid? Am I indirectly the author of a piece that was created by my own art piece, and so forth. So there's an incredible number of legal questions around this."

        "content": "Why did you initially keep it anonymous?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "because the idea was to create life like synthetic life in some way, the fact that there is an author is kind of weird, as opposed to just you have something that exists on its own. So in fact, the Plantoid project has been anonymous for a long time until it was no longer anonymous. But the idea was the artist should be a servant of the artwork, and the artist should only come in when the artwork is hiring someone to create a new copy. But the artist doesn't need to be at the top of the chain, but rather it's at the bottom, and the artwork should be at the top."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "And this is just one of the revolutionary things that Plantoids brought to the world. The artist should be at the service of the artworks and art, which I think is pretty amazing. So the Plantoids are going through different phases. It's almost like they used to be babies and now they are in their adolescents. Adolescents. So the future, I mean, once the thresholds will be reached and really the daos will be created, we will see the next phase. And so for you, also, it's an invitation for you to really feed the Plantoids. It doesn't take. I mean, it's a free. You know, you can decide how much water you want to give to the Plantoids, but really, like, interact with them and talk to them and feed them and help them to reach this threshold and then become a Dao and see developing and hiring artists and creating other Plantoids. I think we want to show you how it works, because it's really worth it. So we're going to do a little demonstration. I would just remind you that just a few days ago, I was reading an article where there have been a lot of articles, but they were, you know, saying that plants talk to each other and like, showing how they talk to each other. So if you still have any doubts, you can come downstairs and see that this is real. Plants talk to each other. They're even gonna talk to you. And yeah, we're gonna show you, I think, a dialogue with the Plantoid"
