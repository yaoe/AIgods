At least, of course there is no predictability on the outcome, but at least there is a very strong guarantees on the manner in which the governance is being undertaken."

So you know, the various technological bricks that can be embedded into a dao."

I mean, like, so you have like the most basic thing of like, okay, do we want to implement some quadratic voting versus conviction voting versus meritocratic token, gated governance system, soulbound tokens, I don't know, like all those, those are all primitives. Right. And then you can combine those primitives together in order to create slightly more sophisticated systems where you might have, you know, multiple by chambers where you have like a plutocratic chamber and a more meritocratic council that can veto or validate the decision. So I mean there is like an infinity of possibilities, but basically identifying the primitives and then deciding how those primitives can be combined into like larger architectures of governance up to the point in which we have a workable system."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I mean, I don't think the crypto space invented any of those governance primitives. I mean, maybe token gated is something that was not so common, but I think the crypto space has innovated on the implementation of those primitives in an infrastructure that, because it is governance by design, does not require monitoring and sanctioning when those primitives are not being followed upon. And that's the usual challenge. It's like, how do we. You can design the coolest governance structure, but then you need to make sure that people are actually playing by the rules. And so you need like an additional layer of governance about monitoring, verifying and potentially enforcing and sanctioning if rules are not followed, which is also a very complex governance structure to put into place. Whereas via the blockchain infrastructure, because those rules, the administration of the governance is directly embedded into a technological system that is automatically enforcing them, then all of sudden this additional layer of monitoring and sanctioning can be reduced, almost eliminated. And I think that's where these eliminate the needs of those more institutional frameworks which have a tendency towards centralization in order to facilitate monitoring and enforcement."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "It makes sense. So you would say that none of this stuff is necessarily new, but more so like a better way to do it because there's less, less need for trust and rules are more so enforced by the system. Let's go into the art side of things. I wanted to ask you about Plantoids. I Found it like a super cool experiment from a few years ago. So yeah, tell us what are plantoids?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, so plantoids are blockchain based life forms. So it's basically an artistic attempt at instantiating a dao into the physical world. And so plantoids are this kind of mechanical plants. The body is in the physical world. The spirit of the plantoid, the soul, is a smart contract on Ethereum. And the idea is to create this type of autonomous entity which is trying to replicate itself, trying to reproduce like any other life forms, but that is also autonomous and self sufficient. And so the way this works is that so every plantoid has its own smart contract system. And the physical mechanical body is connected with this smart contract. So it's monitoring the blockchain and is reacting when the smart contract receive transactions. And so when you feed the plantoid, meaning when you send crypto to the smart contract, the physical body of the plantoid activates itself. And then you can interact with the plant and you can interact via a variety of sensors or like you can talk to it via AI, you can touch it, you can play with it. And every interaction that you're having with the plantoid is actually collecting data. And then this data gets fed to either a generative art algorithm or to a generative AI model. So that via the interaction that you had with the plantoid, the plantoid will generate an artwork that is customized to you because of the interaction. And then this artwork will be minted as an NFT and will be transferred back to you. And so you as a human pollinator, you provide crypto to the plantoid and then the plantoid gives you in exchange a digital seed. And then whenever you're selling this digital seed on the secondary marketplaces, the royalties 10% goes back to feed the plantoid. And so this creates this kind of symbiotic relationship where the more you're speculating on the digital seeds of the plantoids, the more you're actually helping the plantoids in the reproduction process. And then there is a point in which the plantoid has accumulated enough funds to ensure its reproduction. And this is when it becomes a dao and it opens a call for proposals so that people can submit proposition about how they envision to produce the next plantoid. And then all the people that are in possession of One of those NFTs, one of the digital seeds, they can vote on the proposition that they like the most. And the selected winner will then be declared as the new artist that is entitled to create a new plantoid. And then the plantoid will transfer the funds that it has collected until now to the selected winner, who will then be quotation mark hired by the plantoid in order to reproduce itself. And so the idea with all this is that on the one hand is to use art as a way of actually conveying this nice concept of autonomous blockchain based entities, but also to highlight all the legal questions that are surrounding those blockchain based entities, meaning who owns the cryptocurrencies that are received by the Planto Smart contract, even though there is no legal person. And then is the commissioning by the plantoid to the artist to create a new plantoid? Is it an actual legal contract? And if it is, who are the parties of the contract? Because the plantoid doesn't have legal capacity and so is not recognized as a legal system by the ECS system as a legal entity. What happens if the person that was commissioned by the plantard just runs with the money and doesn't deliver on the contract? Who can sue on behalf of whom, etc. So the idea was to just create this kind of very legally contentious art piece that is actually an illustration that there is a lot of legal questions that still need to be resolved."

So there is many spaces of Plantoids that are evolving as the technologies evolves."

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I mean, so the book was written in 2018. So, I mean, it was written. We started it much earlier than that, but we published it in 2018. So it was really at the time in which there were a lot of new things coming into the scene and a lot of uncertainty about how they should be regulated. I will say that when it comes to cryptocurrencies, when it comes to tokens and ICOs, a lot of things have been relatively well understood and regulated over time. I think when it comes to daos, there is a lot of questions that are still open. When it comes to smart contract as well, it's unclear when does a smart contract qualify as a contract. There is still some uncertainty around, like Defi and all these things. So we are slowly and I guess steadily moving towards a place in which some things are being tackled by regulators and legislators. But I will say that the majority of the things that we were envisioning back in 2018 with the book, I would say actually did materialize. And yet there is no definitive regulatory answer to how they should be interpreted even by the legal system. And I think the question of DAOs remains a very important question. We have had a few case jurisprudence on considering daos as general partnership and potential liability of token holders and so forth. But despite the various attempts at creating legal wrappers for daos like, you know, Wyoming, Vermont and so forth. But that's different, right? Because this is about incorporating a DAO as an actual legal structure as opposed to recognizing a dao as a technical infrastructure. And the latter has not yet been fully understood, I will say, by the majority of legal systems."

      {
        "role": "user",

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Well, the biggest issue is twofold. On the one hand, a dao that doesn't have legal recognition cannot engage on its own behalf on a lot of activities that require legal capacity, meaning owning specific assets, entering into contractual relationship and so forth. And so if a DAO wants to, I don't know, rent an office, good luck. If a dao, as a dao, wants to enter into contractual relationship in order to like hire people, it's also very difficult. So there starts to be this kind of like gateways, you know, like opolis work dao and so forth that are putting themselves in the middle so that the DAO interface with this legal entity and then the legal entity is the one actually contracting people. But it's really hard today for a dao to contract, legally speaking, a worker, because Tadao doesn't have legal capacity, so it cannot enter into a contracting relationship. And the other side is, as DAO are operating in the world, the lack of legal personality and limited liability in particular is creating potential liability on all the DAO members independently of whether they would have been liable if there was a legal person that represents the dao. So on the one hand, it's limiting the ability for DAOs to act in the world. On the other hand, it's creating potential liabilities to the members of the DAOs when the DAO act in the world."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "And what do you think about the latest wyoming legislation about DAOs? Does that change any of it? I know there was one that they made like two years ago or something, and then there's been some noise about the latest one, like about last week or so."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, I mean, I think it's important to have this kind of like blockchain based LLC type of structures. But essentially what it is doing is it's enabling a standard corporation to be administered via a blockchain based infrastructure. But to me, there is always something a little bit off when we say that the dao, which operates according to its own technological framework, is wrapped by a legal entity, as opposed to saying that a legal entity is being administered by a dao. But conflating those two things together, I think is a false, is a facade to say, okay, well, actually we provided legal personality to a dao, but actually the legal person, the directors of the legal wrapper, might not have actual power on the way in which the DAO operates. Right. And so it is important to create this wrapper, but it's also important to recognize that the legal wrapper is not the dao, and that the DAO actually, like, you can shut down the legal wrapper, you cannot shut down the dao. You can seize the assets of the legal wrapper if they exist in the physical world, but you cannot seize the cryptocurrencies held by the dao. So there is this kind of fiction by saying that the legal wrapper actually qualify as the legal person of the dao, as opposed to recognizing that there are two entities, a technological entity and a legal entity, which have obviously some interfacing between each other, but one is not the other."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Right? Yeah. How do you think this issue should be solved? And I mean, it will never be able. The state will never be able to control the DAO itself."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yes. So I have a very specific opinion which is part of the DAO model law that we've drafted together with the team at Koala. And the idea is to play with the concept of functional and regulatory equivalence in order to actually recognize that many of the formalities that are required by existing corporate regulations in order to assign legal personality to a particular legal entity could be fulfilled through registration on a blockchain. And so when you register a dao, when you deploy a DAO on a blockchain, you're essentially registering on this decentralized ledger the existence on a company. The reason that we need registration is because we need to be able to verify the existence of those legal entities. But on the blockchain, you can verify the existence by looking at the blockchain. You can understand the bylaws by looking at the operations and the code of the smart contract. So there is a lot of potential functional equivalent features. And then in terms of regulatory equivalence, it's like, well, you cannot. No regulator can impose any rules on a dao. But if the dao is interested in acquiring legal personality, then the regulator can create a set of constraints or formalities that needs to be matched by the dao. And only then will the regulator assign legal personality to this Darwin. So without actually creating this kind of draconian legal framework that tells here is how you have to be, it's more like an invitation. If you do want legal personality, here is the design that you need to abide by. And if you do, we're going to recognize you as a legal person. If you don't, we're just going to continue to ignore you or treat you as a general partnership."

        "content": "So we've actually been collaborating with the state of Utah, and they have done, I think, what could be considered the closest implementation of the Dow Model law, which was done like last year. So I think that's a nice little victory for the DAO modelo because it's also a nice track record. But I think that's the only one that is actually even suggesting the possibility of recognizing an actual dao, as opposed to the legal wrapper of a DAO as a legal person."

And somehow this actually is slowing down any attempt at finding that solution as opposed to trying to collaborate and then sharing the yield of whatever the solution identified can provide.

So when people are creating projects together and the extent to which distributed collaboration can create outcomes, that will be very difficult for a single company or organization to do on its own. And looking at, of course, the challenges, because obviously centralized governance is always easier, but the reason that those system incentivize many people to contribute is that they are not contributing to one centralized entity, but rather they are contributing to an open and distributed ecosystem. And so there is obviously a lot of interesting governance issues that comes about about how do we maintain a viable and prosperous ecosystem of distributed collaboration. How do you incentivize people to collaborate? And I think that's also where the blockchain comes about. Because with tokenizations, reputation, whatever, like it is possible to create incentives without necessarily having to have a centralized entity that is sending out payrolls to people."

One of these frontiers, I guess, that a lot of this DAO stuff and decentralized research and all of that production is kind of leading into these sort of spaces and ecosystems.

And one of them, which is the one that we propose, is the coordination, which is essentially, it's not trying to declare independence and exiting from a particular nation state, but it's rather creating additional layers of sovereignties so that people can join specific, I guess, virtual nation or digital communities, which distinguish themselves from traditional digital community because they have a desire of mutualization of resources, collective action, and most importantly, the desire of becoming more and more interdependent and therefore more intertwined and actually adopt mechanisms that facilitate this type of activities."

But that entity is not a new legal structure. It's not a new technological infrastructure. It's just like a collective notion that we are part of the same thing. And then, and that's where daos can become useful, then we can engage into mutualization. And so instead of, like, exchanging bilaterally, we can put resources in common. And then we, of course, need some degree of governance about how we're going to use those resources and what type of collective action we want to get into. But also, and this is, I think the important point is that there is this need or this desire of becoming more intertwined, meaning, like exchanging equity. So I don't know if in the case of daos, if you create a coordination of DAOs, then DAOs can do like token sharing, token exchange. And so then each DAO owns a little bit of the other DAOs, whether those are like economic tokens or governance tokens. All of students, they actually have the capacity to mutualize resources. But also they have less of an incentive to free ride on those resources because they have exchanged their equity. And so that means that I have no longer an incentive to free ride because if I'm harming you, I'm harming myself because I own a little bit of you and vice versa. And so everyone becomes more incentivized to contribute to the whole because they are all intertwined with one another."

I think that the existing international ecosystem is actually too separated in different national boundaries and there is a very hard time doing like collective action for like problems that are global problems, climate being perhaps the biggest one of them. But not only. And coordination could provide not the answer, but could facilitate this type of global coordination."
