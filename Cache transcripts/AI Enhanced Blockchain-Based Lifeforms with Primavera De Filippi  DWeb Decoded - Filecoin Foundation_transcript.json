        "content": "So I wanted to start off with a discussion about the plantoid project that you've had going for quite a long time now. It's something that I find very fascinating. Autonomous entities or blockchain life forms. Could you give us sort of an overview of that project and you know how the way that you conceive of autonomous entities, blockchain life forms, and a little bit about what you've been doing recently with Plantoids?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Sure. So yeah, the Plantoid project is quite a early project. The first one was born in 2014. At the time, it was the very low first evolutions of a blockchain based life form because it was basically just like a bitcoin eating plant that you will just feed with hens and it will react and do some dancing. And then the plantoid species has evolved as soon as possible. It has moved into Ethereum so that it could actually develop its own smart contract and so forth. And the idea was always to use artistic practice in order to illustrate what I consider to be one of the most amazing and revolutionary aspect of blockchain technology, which is the possibility of creating those autonomous entities that we call DAO today, which have the possibility to be crafted in a way as to be autonomous, but also self sustainable in the sense that they can collect the resources necessary for their own sustenance and possibly also with the possibility of reproducing themselves. And this is where the whole concept of a blockchain based life form came about. And so in the Ethereum iteration, the idea of the planthoid was you would feed the plantoid and you know, the plantoid says thanks you, thank you in its own ways, with light, music, movement and so forth. And the goal of the plantoid was obviously to accumulate as much funds as possible for the purpose of actually reproducing itself. And so every plantoid has a particular threshold that is required in order to reproduce. And then whenever that threshold is met through the donations, then the DAO comes about and it opens a call for proposal. And then people can submit propositions about the way in which they envision the next plantoid to evolve into. And then all the people that have founded the plantoid, they have a voting power on those propositions up to the point in which they were either selected winner and then the plantoid will then transfer the funds and hire the selected winner, the artist that has submitted a proposition to create a new plantoid. So this worked relatively well until I realized that there is the point of the plant is that it's an evolutionary system. And so it needs to evolve based on its environment. And then when, like a few years ago, basically when there has been all this hype and developments around NFTs, I realized actually the planter needs to evolve as well and needs to actually become capable of reproducing itself through digital seeds, where the digital seeds are NFTs. And so the new version of plantoid, which I think so far is the most advanced one, I hope it's going to evolve further. It's not just donation because people are happy to donate, but only a limited number of people want to donate. Whereas now when you feed the plantoid, you're actually pollinating it. And in exchange of that you get an nft. And this NFT is something that you co create with the plantoids. So every plantoid has some kind of generative artwork mechanism, whether it's actually just traditional generative artworks or whether it's like AI based. And so as you feed the plantoid, you get the chance for a limited period of time to interact with the plantoid. And through this interaction, because it has little sensors, it's listening to you, is looking at you, you can touch it, it's taking all this data and it's processing it through AI or other mechanism and is generating an artwork which is a co created artwork, which can be a poem, can be a video, can be music, except. And then it's going to mint this artwork as an NFT and send it back to you. And of course, the more you've paid, the more sophisticated the digital seed will be. And then whenever this digital seed is sold on the secondary market, the royalties go back to the plantoid. So the Plantoid now can collect money bought from the primary market when you feed it in order to collect the nft, which is the digital seed. But also on the secondary market, whenever that seed is being disseminated through the world, it's actually helping the reproduction of the plantoid. And then at the end when the funds have been collected, instead of being as previously, which was the people that Fed gets to vote, now it's the people that actually hold the that digital seed that have the voting power in order to select what will be the evolution of the plantoid through the propositions. And then the same system is just going to hire the artist to reproduce itself. So it's interesting because it's basically leveraging what are all the opportunities that the blockchain and NFT market is providing for those blockchain based life forms to capitalize as much as possible so that then they can reproduce as much and as fast as possible."

What sort of like you were saying, like, you know, you've adopted Ethereum and NFTs into the, into the whole process. But what are some lessons you've learned along the way between, you know, 0 and 15? What kind of adaptations has, has the plantoid developed? Like what are, what are some, some interesting things you've learned through the process?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, I mean it's, it goes, it goes really back to the question of what is a blockchain based lifearm. And a blockchain based life form needs to understand its environment, which is essentially a capitalistic environment. So the lesson learned is that if you want the plantoid to survive and to thrive in its environment, it needs to provide economic incentives for people to feed it. It's like a flower needs not just to be beautiful, but it also needs to provide some, some things back for the bees to come and pollinate them. So in some way, like it's, it's interesting because it's, you know, like I was, I was very reticent to just like jump into the NFT thing just for the sake of NFTs, but in the end it actually turns out that adding the NFT feature to the planter actually immensely increased the. But the poetry of it, because it's actually nice that it has that is capable of reproducing through seeds, but also the effectiveness of it, because like so many more people are donating to plantoids since it is actually providing an NFT in exchange because which is normal is like, you know, either you're just doing philanthropy or you're actually investing into that seed and then you also trying to shield that seed so that you're also giving visibility to plantoids. So it has created a very symbiotic relationship between the people that feed it and the market and the plant oil as opposed to just being this kind of more, please help me and give me money. It has acquired a newfound economic agency by actually being able to provide assets that can be also a reward and a return on investment."

        "content": "So it's the traditional model of Daos and Dao's proposals. So the smart contract creates a call open up the possibility for people to submit propositions. And so anyone, in fact artist, designer, whatever, anyone can submit a proposition and say, well, given the funds that the plantoid has committed, here is what I'm proposing, right? And obviously every plantoid has also some like genetic code that needs to be always passed to its descendants. So they have to be made of chains. They need to have like the Creative Common License. And then different plant will add different requirements. So right now there is this species of NFTs that are all about AI generative artwork. So every time to reproduce, the new planter needs to fulfill also those requirements. So anyone can submit propositions. There is no restriction, but then only if you hold one of the digital seeds that have been issued by this plantoid, you have the right to vote. And then when you get like a majority of seeds that vote on a particular proposition once, once there is like once there is a selected winner after a particular period of time, then automatically the plantoid will transfer the funds to the winner of the proposition. The only non Automatic thing is that the artist that has created the plantoid also need to approve the transfer just in order to avoid some kind of like, you know, Sibyl attack. But the artist cannot take the money or cannot choose where the money goes. He can just approve or veto once a collective decision has been made by the seeds."

And I think like you were saying pre. The pre nft, a lot of the, the, the idea behind it was it was kind of like you know, pleading with, with people to, to feed it. And I think the esthetics were, were a big part of that. Can you describe like the physicality of the planto?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah. So like when you see them, you might not immediately think that it's a blockchain based art piece because they are very physical. It's like all the plant are made of like metal chains and then like mostly recoup materials so far at least. But it's basically like, yeah, you take, you take chains and then you create a plant with different elements. And then they, they all are electronics. So there is like a little brain, usually a little Arduino or Raspberry PI that is controlling the plantoid, that is monitoring the blockchain so that it can make the plantoid react when there is a transaction. So whenever you feed the plantoid, the brain of the physical piece detects it and then activates it. And then when it's activated, that's when you can interact with the sensor. So things like DJ Plantoids, which has little, little knobs and buttons. And so you can be the dj. You can create generative music during that particular period of time. Blindhood 14 is more of a poet, so you can speak with it. And then there is like a little back and forth and then it's going to generate a poem and mint that poem as an NFT. And planet on 15 is like the most advanced. So it's like this little metal sculpture, but then you can feed it. It starts speaking to you and then it also generates a poem, but then it use AI in order to illustrate that poem. And so you have this kind of audio visual recording that then gets minted as an nft. So it's really like. It's just like with nature, there is different species that are competing with each other for attention and in this case for capital. And you need to both have the best physical instantiation. So it's really important that this culture itself looks nice. But also the governance structure is also very important. So you need to like but with at the NFT level but also like. So there has different planters that have been experiment with different, different governance structure. One of the plan was, was using like the Dow stack model. Another plant was like a charity, so it was giving 50% of its collection to a nonprofit. So it's really like, it is a digital Darwinism and it is an evolutionary algorithm and the plant on who knows what the environment wants. And so the plant are kind of like experimenting and trying to see what facets and what feature are going to be the most fit for the environment. And if the environment likes them, they're going to collect more money. Therefore they're going to be able to reproduce more and eventually colonize the planet. The plant that are not really appreciated by the environment, they just will fade into extinction."

So for the people interested, they can go and check it out there.

You know, there's always the example of the autonomous taxi or something. You know, you, you, you own, you have you, you know, your own autonomous car when you're not using it. It can drive around, pick people up and drop them off and sort of Generate passive income and it can even use those funds intelligently to charge itself. There are all different versions of this. How has this experience sort of informed your your take on, on those sort of future forms of tech?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, I mean this is actually the reason that the planet was created in the first place was because within my research, Evan, I was talking a lot about those things and every time it feels a little bit like, especially in 2014, it feels a lot like I'm talking about science fiction and actually creating the planet as an instance in order to show. Well actually it is not science fiction. It can be done. Now whether it's going to actually colonize the planet, I don't know. But it can be done. It's right here and right now. Let's look at it and let's think about it. One learning that I think is an important learning and I'm extremely attached to the physicality of Plantoids. But it's that when we talk about blockchain based life forms, I think it's difficult whenever there is this interface with the physical world and it is not a fully blockchain based life form because there is this physicality. So it is actually like a hybrid between metal based life form or electronics based life forms and a blockchain based life form which creates. It's really important I think from the aesthetics and from the artistic perspective of it. Also the possibility of interacting with a physical entity really changes the way in which this whole art piece is perceived. What I've learned is that it is difficult to talk about a pure blockchain based life form when it is actually not a pure blockchain based life form. Because you also have the problem of the oracles. You have the question of how do you deal with that little brain? What happened if the little brain gets broken? Then you have the spirit of the planet on Ethereum, but there is no longer the interaction that is possible. So I noticed that while I think they are still blockchain based life forms, they are not pure form of blockchain based life forms. And in fact my next mission as the next evolution of a blockchain based life form will be another form of artpiece that is a pure blockchain based lifeform that that has similar property of autonomy, self evolution, reproductibility, but that does not involve the physical world at all. And also that dig even further into this kind of symbiotic mutual instrumentalization of humans, market based mechanism and blockchain with the purpose of actually creating those non ownable entity because it Feels wrong that you can own a blockchain based life form. So it's like those non ownable tokens that have the capacity to be interacted with even though you cannot actually possess them and yet have the possibility of reproducing itself and will reward the people that are contributing to their genetic code in order to enable the revolution with some funds. In various situations it's a little bit. It might take one hour to explain the whole model, but it's going to be born shortly."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "And in terms of these digital life forms or these autonomous entities, what are some like? So from these learnings and from this experience, what are some viable, like in your opinion, what are some viable practical uses for this technology like the self driving car that you know, picks people up and drops them off for passive income? Like what are, what are some categories of autonomous entities that you, you could see emerging in the next 25 years that are, that are really going to change the way things work?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure, like, I think the autonomous tax is a very good example because people can easily relate to it. I don't know if that's going to be the most revolutionary type of element, but I think it's interesting because it opened up new windows of possibilities as to business models. I think for the art world, it's fascinating. By the way, I think it's very interesting, especially now with AI and whatever. I think the focus that we have had so far on the artist as being like the core entity, the core focus of attention. And then we give money to an artist mainly because we hope that the artist will continue to create works that we like. Whereas now, because we can give this kind of technological and economical agency to the art piece itself, we can create systems that are very different in which you will fund the art piece instead of funding the artist. And then it is the art piece that is then electing which artist is entitled to produce more of it. So we're kind of like shifting around the world concept of like copyright, where the artist is the ultimate decision maker into a model in which actually we can promote the production of art by focusing on the art piece rather than the artists. I think this is a very interesting field to explore that I hope Plantoids and those new blockchain based life form will inspire. I think there is also, in fact, through the period, through the years, I've had a few people reaching out about how can the plantoid model be applied to different things. In fact, at the Museum of Digital Art there was another project that was Actually directly inspired from planet Earth, which is this self owned house which rents itself and then use the funds to upgrade itself or to replicate itself, et cetera. So there is like a lot of models I had some people that were discussing like for community gardens. So all those things that I think have more of like a collective and communal aspect to it. It's interesting, like you can fund a community garden for the community garden to reproduce itself. So even when we think about like common goods and public goods, this is an interesting mechanism which. But it's not. The problem I think today is that we rely too much on like donation and philanthropy for public goods as opposed to actually coming up with a model in which the public good itself can also generate an economic incentive for people to interact with it and for people to actually donate. But it's no longer just donation, it's actually an economic transaction so that the public goods can foster and replicate while also not being dependent only on people that understand the value of the public goods, but also the people that are doing that for purely private and economic interest and yet they have an incentive to actually donate funds or transfer funds to those public goods. So I think my vision is more like the self autonomous car I think is very private centered. But I think those kind of models are really interesting for communal goods and things that the collective benefit from, but also that you don't want to have one profit center that is the ultimate decision maker about where it's going to be, the next one, how it's going to be and actually enabling the community that has invested into it to also have a decision making and be more participatory in the decision of the evolution."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I think this is a good segue into the portion of discussion about NFTs digital ownership and intellectual property because I feel like NFT technology, while it's mainly been applied to one off, one of a kind works, there is a huge opportunity with NFT technology to create more open, more collaborative artwork or just, you know, work in general. And you know, we're seeing this and I know that, you know, you've been, you've been doing some work on, on this a bit yourself, but that they sort of facilitate or, or make easier collaboration and profit sharing and things like that. Could you describe a little bit of your work with Remix NFT and the ways in which we can use NFT technology to bring, you know, creation something closer to Creative Commons rules and sort of computationalize and integrate that into, into digital artwork?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, yes, basically. So I'm, I'm a strong proponent. And I've been involved with the Creative Commons network, like for more than 10 years now. So I'm a very strong believer in like, you know, sharing information, openness, open culture and so forth. And it's interesting because the NFT world somehow oftentimes is actually perceived as antagonist to the Creative Commons values because there is all this focus on creating digital scarcity, which is in fact totally against what Creative Commons is trying to do, which is trying to remove the artificial scarcity created by copyright. At the same time, I actually strongly believe that the NFTs might be one of the most beautiful gift that the blockchain ecosystem has given to Creative Commons. Because all of students, we are not talking about scarcity at the level of the artwork, we're actually talking about scarcity at the level of the copy, which is something that exists in the physical world but doesn't exist in the digital world. And so if you think about it, in the digital world, the only way in which an artist up until recently could monetize its work is through the licensing of copyright. And so obviously you don't want to be fully open because then you really have no way of monetizing your work. Whereas, thanks to NFTs, now all of Sudan, there is actually a business model also for Creative Common artists which are now in the possibility of completely opening up their copyright, like CC Buy or even there is a lot of CC0 artists in the NFT space, because you can sell the copy and so the work can be freely disseminated everywhere. But if you want the original authentic copy of that work, then you're going to buy the nft. And all of a sudden this is amazing because it is actually perfectly in line with the value of Creative Commons. But at the same time, I think we can do even better. And so with Remix nft, the idea was to create a protocol, a particular NFT protocol that actually demonstrates that we can design more advanced versions of NFTs that are actually promoting the value, actively promoting the value of Creative Commons, in particular in the Remix sense. And so Remix NFT is a project that I initiated many years ago, following actually a prompt from Creative Commons to show them that NFT can be friendly. And the idea is that basically if I release a work under Remix nft, there is this mechanism in which no one can fully own these Remix NFT because it's on a perpetual auction, so anyone can overbid in order to obtain that copy. But the Remix NFT is actually a right, it's actually embedded with a license which enabled Me to create a remix of the work that I've just purchased. And so all of Sudan, because of the perpetual auction, there is an incentive to buy the remix as early as possible, while it's still very cheap to buy, and then create remix. And I can create derivative works because I have the right to do so. And then of course, people can buy my remix or the original remix. But obviously there is a point in which the original remix, because of the perpetual auction, might become very expensive. And so people will be like, okay, well, maybe I don't want to spend the money to remix the original, but I'm going to remix the remix of the original. And so in some way, this particular protocol creates a system of mimification, in which, because I have put my work under this remix NFT protocol, it is an invitation to the world to remix as much as possible my work. And then of course, within that protocol, there is a system of automatic rewards and redistribution. So on the one hand, because they are all linked to one another, it provides attribution, which is something that is very difficult for creative common artists, especially in the digital world. Whereas here, because every NFT is the remix of another nft, I can trace through the blockchain the genealogical evolution of those works. But also there is an automatic royalty system. So if someone then buys the NFT of any of those remixes, then the funds that are collected are brought in into the smart contract. And then the people from whom that remix has been created, they also have a share that they can claim from this. And so this means that all of a sudden, as an artist, I have an economic incentive to actually promote the creation of derivative works, because the more people are creating derivative works, the more money I make because they are purchasing the remix. But also the more popular those remixes are. And actually I want them to be popular, I want them to sell very expensively, because then I'm going to get a share. And so in some way this solves like the three main problem of Creative Commons, which is one, the lack of the copy. And all of a sudden the NFT as such, provide the copy, it resolves the attribution problem, because now we can really easily follow and trace how remixes are made. And then it resolves the business model and the incentivization so that instead of monetizing my work by closing the copyright by doing non derivative or non commercial here, on the contrary, I want them to be derivative and commercialized, because this will also maximize my own return."

        "content": "Yeah, so right now we're actually experimenting with our first application, which is essentially for generative AI, because there is, like, lots of people spending hours and hours just clicking, you know, variation, variation, prompting and whatever, and they're actually doing work. And sometimes you find a particular coordinate in the latent space that is amazing. And then because someone has discovered this coordinate, then many other people can now orbit it around those coordinates to discover other things in the same area of the latent space. And then maybe someone finds an amazing place, and then this becomes like a popular NFT that is sold. And in some way it's interesting, because generative AI copyright literally doesn't matter. I mean, at least until now, there is no copyright on the generative AI, and yet those people are doing a lot of work. And yet you can monetize it, because now you can NFT it. And even though I don't, I cannot claim copyright over it. I'm still the creator and I am the NFT minter, so I can still monetize. But my mint, my NFT is only existing because I could rely on someone else that has traveled and that has spent hours or beating within the latent space. And so because mine was a derivative of the auto one, then when I sell my NFT for like $5 million, that person will get a big share of that, because that person is actually the one that enabled me to find that coordinates in the latent space. And so the generative AI, I think, is a fascinating case study for this, because first, it's easy to understand how the dependencies are, because it's literally like I'm taking your coordinates and I'm expanding on it. Secondly, because it is so contentious about whether or not there is copyright, and in some way it doesn't matter. It could be CC0, it will still work, right? So because I can create a technological infrastructure where I created a derivative from your work and that's connected through the blockchain, it doesn't matter if I can claim a copyright on it or not. In fact, the fact that I am the artist that minted it, I am the one that will monetize the nft. But I don't want to monetize it just for myself, because I want to reward all the people that have supported by exploring this infinite space of the Latent space. And so this kind of reward mechanism makes it so that we're all collaborating towards finding those most amazing coordinates and everyone is rewarded according to the actual contribution that they have done."

So I can choose to share the coordinates to whoever purchased the remix nft and then based on this remix nft, they can then travel in the surrounding area of these multi dimensional vector coordinates. So generative AI is actually the most obvious and simple and yet very, very valuable application of this protocol."

One thing that I see as a possibility would be like AI artists, basically people who are not people, but digital entities who are going through other people's works and remixing them and like learning from whether or not people enjoy their work and sort of honing in on something better. Do you see something like that in the future, these, these digital entities, you know, being creative and remixing people's work and participating in this whole ecosystem."

So a good friend of mine, Jean Cogan, is actually working on similar thing, which is called Abraham, which ideally is this type of autonomous artist that is generating AI and that gets feedback from the community in order to understand what is pleasing, what is less pleasing. I think the only issue today when we talk about actual blockchain based lifeform is that to my knowledge, the blockchain today is not really viable for doing on chain generative AI. So there is a few projects that are actually merging for like blockchain based or decentralized inferential AI and so forth. But I think we're still at the experimental phases on that. So right now, while I think those projects definitely will come about, it's not a pure blockchain based lifeform, meaning that the processing of the AI model definitely today is still done off chain. So you can have a blockchain based life form that then probably will need to somehow transfer funds to someone to do the processing and Then mint it and send it back and then get the curation through the on chain. So it is possible there will always be some kind of like oracle somewhere off chain that is doing the work. Maybe in the coming years we might be able to see some native blockchains that are capable of also doing generative AI. But yeah, I'm very looking forward to all this. Yes."

So you know, you and especially if something is remixable, you're going to need for example in a song, if you're going to remix a song, you're going to need all of the stems or the individual tracks, the guitar track, drum track, voice vocals track. How do you link the actual digital assets that make up the work to the license? And how do you sort of do the process of blowing the work apart, remixing it and maintaining that it is the derivative work of someone else."

        "content": "Yeah. So indeed, as a consequence of building and developing the remix NFT protocol, we very soon came into a realization that we need licensing to be associated with every single one of those tokens. And this licensing cannot be done in the way in which it is currently done on the majority of NFT platforms, which is the time of use are actually dictating what are the rights that are associated with the nft? Because ideally there is no platform first of all. And also we don't want the platform to be able to change the term of use and therefore the copyright associated with the NFTs. And so we developed together with a small cohort of blockchain lawyers, blockchain and IP lawyers, we developed this new type of copyright licensing scheme which we have called the token boundaries NFT license. And the idea here is to create it's quite innovative in some way because the problem in general is like usually you get a license from the copyright owner and this license is actually either non transferable or it requires some degree of sub licensing, meaning that if I transfer my work then all of a sudden I need to transfer the license or I need to sub license it, which creates a lot of complexities, legal complexity, because especially if there is like so many remix of all directions and so forth. And so what we wanted to do was creating a legal system that ensure that the license automatically follows the tokens without having to rely on sublicensing. And so we found this very elegant solution which is the one that is incorporated into the token bound license, which is relying on a dual licensing model both of which are public licenses. So in the same way with like Creative Commons is a public license, is a public general license, just like the gpl, which means it's a license that is given to the world at large. There is no personal license associated. It's not like I give you a license. The whole world can benefit under some conditions that are stipulated in the license. And so what we've done is that we created this kind of general public license, which is the terms and condition under which the work is released by default, if you don't own the token, and you can choose to be as restrictive or open as you want, and then another public license, which is conditional. So it's a conditional general public license where the condition is that you are the current holder of the nft. And this is very interesting because it means that I don't need to think about personal licenses, I don't need to think about sub licenses, because actually it is to the world at large. Except that the only way in which you can claim benefits of this license is that you can demonstrate that you currently hold the nft. And if you don't hold the NFT even though the license is open to the world at large, then you cannot claim those benefits. And so that's pretty good, because that means that the moment in which I'm transferring the token, even though the license is exactly the same, the condition is no longer met for me, and now it's met for you. And so now you can benefit from those licensing terms. I think this is like a very elegant solution to a much broad problem in the NFT world. First, that we are not embedding the licenses into the token, which I think should be done as a very standard practice. And secondly, to ensure that these license actually follow the token every time it is being transferred, without creating all the legal complexity of sublicensing."

        "content": "Yeah, so I don't want to claim ownership on the concept of Cody's Law, which was actually created by Lawrence Lassig, but it is a large portion of my research which is looking at the way in which code is taking specific functions that usually were assigned to the law. And the way I'm thinking about it, and the way I'M investigating it in my research is basically the concept of regulatory equivalence, which means that today the law stipulate various manners in which a particular actor can comply with specific regulations. And those are like the traditional legal formalities and so forth. And then now we have new technologies which are quite different. So they are not like we cannot rely on the traditional concept of functional equivalence because the function is not the same. Yet the concept of regulatory equivalence, which is a little bit more subtle, is that because of the technological guarantees and the technological properties that those new technology provide, in the case of blockchain, then we can now actually achieve the same policy objectives through different technologies. If I want to be regulatory compliant, I now can choose would I follow the traditional legal formalities as specified within the law, where the law was actually designed at the time in which the technology didn't exist. And so that was the only way in which we could conceive of regulatory compliance. But now that this new technology came with those new technological guarantees, if regulatory equivalence is recognized between those two, it means that now I have a choice. Do I want to comply through the traditional formalities in order to be regulatory compliant, or do I want to adopt those alternative technological means which actually achieve the same policy objective and therefore are an alternative path towards regulatory compliance. This is kind of like the facets that I'm looking at. So it's a particular direction of how code is law, which is not just saying that code is replacing or supplanting the law, but that code can actually be used as a regulatory technology to achieve regulatory compliance in ways that actually in some cases are more transparent, more accountable and more efficient than the traditional paper based formalities."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah. So blockchain constitutionalism is yet another facet of this, which is blockchain constitutionalism is essentially looking at how we are creating systems where there is not one party that can kind of instrumentalize the code. So in traditional legal system, we have the concept of the rule of law, which basically means that no one stands above the law, the law applies equally to everyone, including the sovereign is actually subject to the same legal framework as opposed to the rule by law, which is when the sovereign is actually instrumentalizing the legal system in order to further its own political interest. And so, and this is just like traditional legal theory now when we move this into the digital space, we can actually observe that there is some kind of analogy in the sense that if we look at the majority of online platforms today, they are ruled by code, meaning that there is a sovereign, which is the operator, which is instrumentalizing the code in order to further its own economic or potentially political interest. So somehow the code doesn't apply equally to everyone because the operator can constantly modify, change, shut down the code. When we move into blockchain systems, we move into a system that, by analogy to the rule of law, looks more like the rule of code, where the rule of code stipulates that no one stands above the code. So even though I am the developer, even though I am the one that has deployed a particular blockchain system, I don't actually have the power to shut it down. I don't have the power to influence its operation, to manipulate it. I am equal to everyone else based on what the code prescribed. And so all of Sudan, we enter into this model that is more of a constitutional model, in which there are some technological guarantees that the code, once deployed, will operate as planned. Of course, there is always bugs and flows in some cases, but there is no one single unilateral actor that actually is the sovereign over the systems. This is actually what provide those technological guarantees, which therefore can enable new mechanism of regulatory compliance. Because I will never trust a technological guarantee that that is provided by a system where there is one single operator that can manipulate the data. If you want to do auditing and reporting, I'm not going to trust you giving me a database of information that I know you could manipulate. However, if you've been using a blockchain to record information, and if I trust the security and the reliability of this blockchain, I know you couldn't modify it. And so therefore, the information you provide me is actually much more reliable. And so I can actually use that as a proof that you acted in the way that you claim, which will never work if it's an internal database of a company which obviously has economic incentive to manipulate this information before sending it to me. So the rule of code is kind of a precondition for this concept of regulatory equivalence and using blockchain technology as a new way of doing regulatory compliance to exist."

So sort of structuring things out in the open that are like, you know, the way that it's actually constructed is more openly compliant, and like it's visibly following the rules in a way. And also the way that it's structured, it's actually enacting those regulations that's really interesting. So in 2018 you published blockchain and the Law. And I'm actually curious, well, could you give I guess, an overview of that work and then also I guess what were some things that you were right about and then some things that have surprised you and changed and how is your view of the overall topic of. Of that book evolved?"

And literally we had to keep revising, revising, revising every six months. Not because the law was evolving, but because the technology was evolving. And then 2018 we were like, okay, that's it, we have to publish now, otherwise we're never going to publish. What's interesting is, is that I think 2018 is perhaps when the technology became more like established. What's interesting is that the book in fact is still quite relevant. It's not obsolete yet because the law actually has not evolved as fast as it could have. There is a lot of things that were already visible or at least foreseeable back in 2018 which actually have just further consolidated themselves on the legal front. So actually the surprising thing is that the book is still relevant, meaning that we might need to do some. The law is coping up, but it's not copying up in any way that was not expected. The book, the main theory of the book was like we brought about this concept of the rule of code lex cryptographica, where we were explaining the fact that there is those new possibilities that are emerging to create system that have their own internal regulatory framework. But then of course it's not because you can have your own internal endogenous system of regulation that the exogenous system of regulation will not try to intervene. And I think what we're seeing is that unfortunately, I guess, but our prediction of how the legal system might try to intervene in order to regulate a system that is actually designed not to be regulatable actually have come true. Perhaps the sec. There's no surprise about this. I think perhaps the surprising thing that we didn't envision was the sanctions for in the case, for instance, of tornado cash, but also not surprising. So, yeah, in some ways the surprise is that there are not as many surprises as I would have hoped for. So the book is still surprisingly on the point. And yeah, I think a lot of the prediction which weren't prediction, it was more like here are all the possible ways in which it might go. Many of them actually have come true. Some of them were already visible early on, but now they have become more visible than before. So yeah, I think the law is evolving. Of course in Europe we have the MIC and so forth. Things are evolving, but are evolving somehow in a predictable direction which is the same direction that has been taken with the Internet. And every time there are those technologies that are decentralized and trying to escape, obviously the existing legal system will not just sit down and watch. They will try to find the low hanging fruits, where are the weak points and try to regulate those weak points in the same way as on the Internet. We regulate the large intermediaries because we cannot regulate decentralized networks. But there is always, even in a polycentric decentralized networks there are always operators and there are always some degrees of actors that are actually in a particular jurisdiction and they can be regulated."
