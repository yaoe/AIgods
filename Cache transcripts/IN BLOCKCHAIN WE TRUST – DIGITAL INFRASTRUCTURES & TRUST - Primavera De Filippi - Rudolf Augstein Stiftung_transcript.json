And so we have this trusted intermediary which is helping us to coordinate ourselves and to collaborate.

So we have, let's say the blockchain, lots of data. We have software analyzing this data and deriving decisions based on this data automatically, autonomously, maybe with some artificial intelligence self learning systems. And now you have the question of accountability. I mean, if we have institutions, we vote, we, we live in a democracy and we can get rid of those who, I don't know, didn't make the right decisions. But once we have this software installed and we can't even look into algorithms today, let alone we have a whole software and the software built upon it, and what do we vote for?

So in the case of land registry, that's the idea. It's not about eliminating the state as the oversight, but it's about asking the government to actually use this technology so that it basically cannot change the data anymore or to actually use it in order to provide more transparency. In terms of the voting system, you can actually use a voting system using the blockchain as a technical infrastructure. But that doesn't mean that it's going to replace the whole institution.\nIt's just a tool in the same way as we use the Internet in order to communicate, but we're not replacing it everything. And the main problem I think today is like, so you have a lot of ideas and really interesting visions of how you could indeed create those decentralized autonomous organizations. But for instance, I mean, even if you try to disintermediate like Uber, so you have a few blockchain based applications that wants to provide the same service as Uber, but without Uber. Right, but, but of course you have the coordination and you have the transactional level that can be really easily replaced with a blockchain. But then there is all the governance that comes around it that definitely we probably do not want an algorithm or have a smart contract on the blockchain to regulate this. And this is what I was mentioning at the end is that we have this technology which is really powerful and.\nWe need to understand what are the limits and where does it actually make sense to use it. But then what we're really lacking today is this layer of governance that can be put on top of those infrastructure. Because if you actually want to enjoy the full benefits of those decentralized organization it's not enough to have a decentralized infrastructure if you don't have a decentralized governance system. And it's not by using an algorithm. An algorithm is not necessarily a decentralized governance system. It's just centralized governance in the hand of, of an algorithm. So the fact that you don't have an institution as an intermediary doesn't change the fact that you still have an intermediary. It's just code. So the really beautiful vision of the blockchain is actually when we manage to combine decentralization at the infrastructural level and the distribution of power on top of this decentralized infrastructure.\nBut I think we're kind of starting to figure out the infrastructure, like the decentralization of the infrastructure. But I think we're really far, we're really just starting now to try and look at what kind of distributed governance model we can use on top of this. And today if we look at the majority of the blockchain based applications, it's basically market, because that's what we know. So most of the blockchain based applications are basically market driven and the market oftentimes concentrates. And so we end up again with centralization on top of this decentralized infrastructure."

And in fact, bitcoin is really interesting because it has these. And that's the whole thing with trustlessness. So if we want a trustless technology, we just assume that we cannot trust anyone. So if you look at Bitcoin, it's amazingly elegant, mathematically really beautiful system. But again, it only works as this closed system.

But this is what actually guarantees the security.\nThe problem with this design is that we actually, because we are assuming that everyone is potentially a cheater, we don't trust anyone. But we're also losing, in fact, probably like 90% of the people will not be cheater. But we just have to design the most trustless system just because there might be this 5 or 10% of people that might be cheater and we cannot know who they are. And so this approach to our trustlessness actually create a really inefficient system. Even though it is actually elegant, but it's in terms of energy consumption, it's a little bit ridiculous.

They are the accountability, the immutability, the irreversibility, et cetera, which can be extremely useful in some very specific things. And we need to focus on those. And then eventually maybe we can build the blocks and figure out how by combining all those things, we can actually manage to create fully decentralized organizations. But now there is just this jump towards directly going there and obviously we don't really know what we're doing and then things break. So I think there is, there's a lot of cultural work maybe to do. Like the technology still needs to evolve and still needs to be fully understood to its potential.

We are a society and there must be a common control on what is going on. We need laws, we need rules legitimated by democratic elections and so on. And perhaps this algorithm might be used to make some procedures in our society more trustworthy and more accountable. But on the other hand, we need a clear understanding, a better understanding where it is useful to use these technologies, for example, for privacy protection.

But sometimes you need like these really complex layers of laws which then need to be enforced and etc. And perhaps we can identify ways in which the technology could actually enforce those law automatically. But it doesn't mean that we just get rid of the institution around it. It's just that we plug the technology within the institution so that the institution becomes more accountable.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses."
