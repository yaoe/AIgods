And the spelling is actually important. So the question is essentially how we use technology or can we leverage technology in order to create a more open, decentralized, pluralistic society which actually incentivize more cooperation rather than competition."

        "content": "just to begin perhaps with an important observation, which is that when we talk about plurality, plurality can be both a source of competition to the extent that we have a greater number of actors that are trying to acquire a particular set of resources or which are trying to achieve a particular outcome. And so this can generate in some case some kind of zero sum game where there is winners and losers, and therefore people end up competing in order to be the winners."

        "role": "assistant",

And then if we don't like that new system, it's no problem, because anyone can create yet another system."

And once we adopt this interdependent mindset that then we can no longer focus only and exclusively on the notion of exit, but instead we need to think in a more common based approach, because it becomes fundamental to identify ways to govern and to manage those resources that we are mutually dependent upon."

By providing this system of incentivization that ensure that there is enough contribution to this common infrastructure and also prevent overexploitation by requiring that people expand tokens in order to access the service. And so we can then create this common base infrastructure that is scalable, that is elastic and that is not subject to free riding."

This is actually not such a popular saying, but it is nonetheless worth analyzing in the sense that blockchain technology is indeed as many other technology, it's a double edged sword in the sense that on the one hand it enabled those new modalities for collective actions, which is based on peer to peer collaboration, common based production, and therefore enable those new types of distributed cooperation."

But because it is focused on this exit based system, it is actually creating competition amongst nation state and network state and among multiple network states. And so again, we can see how in this context plurality is used and leveraged as a source of competition rather than a source of cooperation."

And so we're still trying to find what's the right name for it. So please help us."
