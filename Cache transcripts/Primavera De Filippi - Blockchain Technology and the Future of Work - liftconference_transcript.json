Unfortunately we couldn't have the time to build a plantoid for the conference, but I had the chance to see it being put alive and playing in Sydney in December thanks to Prima. And actually during the weekend at the local Bioacor space aquarium, we will have people who are trying to implement the plantoid, remix it and maybe for next year you will have a plantoid that you can play with. Thank you very much, Primario."
