So intellectual property, which is essentially a way to realign the property of the general abstract artwork, the work of authorship, which is by its intrinsic nature something that is both non rival and non scarce because it is essential information, it can be freely reproduced and Everyone can benefit from a particular artwork without necessarily preventing authors from also benefiting from it. So there is no rivalry in consumption."

And so copyright introduced artificial scarcity on the work of art and in some way managed to realign the artworks with the properties of the physical medium. So by creating this kind of artificial scarcity in information goods, we can now trade IP intellectual property in the same way as we're trading physical objects."

And then we have the digital medium, which is inherently non rival and non scarce. So as we integrate a copyrighted work into a digital file, again there is a discrepancy because the file can be freely reproduced at almost no cost, and there is no rivalry in consumption, but the artwork is because of copyright."

So blockchain technology for the have perhaps the first time in history enabled to create some kind of technical scarcity on digital information."

Just in the same way as an author can sell a book, and that does not entail at all the transfer of the licensing of the copyright in the book, but just the physical copy of the book.

Whereas in this model, artists have the highest incentive to maximize the visibility, the dissemination of the work, because that means that they will have more likely to be funded and then again to maximize the creation of remixes, because that's also what will provide a higher amount of royalties."

In fact, most of the Plantoids today are doing musical thing, but it needs to be something that is immaterial, because otherwise you cannot really make it into an nft. So it can be video, it can be audio, it can be just like a static image, but it cannot be a sculpture because that would require a very complicated planto that makes an actual physical item, which is possible. But then the NFT will be much more, will be not necessarily associated with that piece.\nSo there is no guarantee that by selling the nft, you are selling the piece.

I can. I can. I can interact with it. And then as I interact with it, data is being collected. This data is the seeds for algorithm. It can be like a generative art algorithm, whether or not we want to call it AI. Or it can be an actual, like one of those new large model, like Dall E or like whatever musical music, like prompting. So it can also. The data can become seeds for a prompt that we can send to one of those. It can be a poetry. I can use ChatGptree or whatever."

Are you showing the interaction of other artists responding to those forms or in impacting those forms? Because I got the sense from your.

So it was a very simple creature. And this is pretty much the one that has reproduced itself the most because it was the first one. And then you can see how different. Different plant come with different traits. Right. So again, Plantoid 2 had this kind of like bulb, like light bulb that will create like rainbows. And. And so Plantoid 4 also introduced that and then planted 3, started having wings. And so all the following one also have wings planted. 5 started introducing this movement. And so like when you feed it, it start like moving the head like this. And so Plantoid 9, which is stemming from it, also has the same type of movement. And then Plantoid 3 also reproduce itself into Plantoid 11, 10, and 12, which all have wings. And then each one of them also have their own criteria. So whenever they will reproduce, they also will have to adopt this particular genetic code."

And I just started adding the NFT system when there is the NFT hype that came about, because I was like, okay, it's time to upgrade the plantoid. But so right now it's music.

And as you get closer, or as you touch them, or as the wind blows, it will activate the sensors and it will create or modify the music that was constantly being fed to this generative algorithm. And so people eventually will start jamming and starting to explore how to jam together."

And so the idea was to illustrate as well, like distributed consensus, where there is no centralized chef d' orchestre that is dictating people what to do. But there is this kind of, like.
