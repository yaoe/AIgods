And I started by looking mostly at what are the legal implications, so what are the legal challenges that this technology rise and. But also how they are actually affecting the legal system. But then as I started researching those technology further, I soon noticed that there is actually really an immense field of opportunities that they provide. And this is how my research has a little bit moved away from. Well, I'm still looking at all the legal implications, but now I'm also mostly looking at what are the new opportunities that they provide, most notably in terms of how they can help autonomous organizations and household communities to actually organize and coordinate themselves without relying on the traditional model of hierarchical organization that we know."

So I will start with the screen. Okay. Okay. So, well, I guess we can start from the beginning, which is Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, as you probably all know, is the first decentralized cryptocurrencies, which was developed in 2009. And essentially, it is a technological mechanism that enables people to exchange value with one another without really needing any kind of centralized clearinghouse or financial intermediary. So in some way, Bitcoin operates completely independently from the government and from the central bank. It is really just value that is created digitally. But the innovation that Bitcoin brings is that it is now possible to exchange this value. And even though it relies on a completely decentralized network, it is virtually impossible to actually cheat. So it is impossible to spend twice the same value, the same currency, because there is this system of distributed consensus that verifies constantly that every transaction is correct. And so the main innovation of Bitcoin is essentially the idea that it is now possible to bypass the need of those banks or financial intermediaries and a decentralized network or community can now operate and coordinate itself independently."

Now the important thing is that Bitcoin is actually just one out of many possible applications of this new technology. And very soon it became apparent that there is actually many, many, many new things that can be built on top of the same technology. And so that's when people started to distinguish the concept of Bitcoin, which is an application, which is a decentralized payment system, with the underlying technology which is blockchain, and the blockchain, essentially it's a distributed database or a public ledger which is completely decentralized and which relies on those cryptographic, primitive and distributed consensus algorithm in order to coordinate individuals in a peer to peer manner. And so again, the real, the key factor of the blockchain is that people that are distributed and that do not actually know each other and therefore do not trust each other, can now interact with one another without the need to rely on one centralized or trusted third party."

        "content": "as the technology started to become more and more understood, then people decided to design alternative platforms or alternative application initially running on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. But it soon become quite obvious that the Bitcoin blockchain, because it was designed to be an actual payment system, it had a few limitations. It was actually complicated to add functionalities on top of this network. And so people started developing alternative blockchains which are designed to actually be more general purpose and to enable people to deploy specific application on top of them. So in some way you can imagine that it's more of if Bitcoin was an actual payment application, then the new blockchain technology, such as for instance Ethereum and another general purpose technology, are more of a decentralized operating system which enable anyone to block their own application. Deploy it on top of the blockchain, and this application becomes a decentralized application that that is run in a completely decentralized manner by every node that is connected to the network. And the specificity of this is that in the same way as the Bitcoin, blockchain is a trustless application in the sense that you always know that the transaction is valid because it has been verified by everyone in the blockchain situation. Every application that is run on top of this is also trustless in the sense that you always know it is predominant, predeterministic, you always know exactly how it's going to be executed and no one can actually cheat. So it's really different from the current model of online platforms, which are mostly these kind of black boxes in which nobody really knows what is going on."

        "content": "one really interesting aspect that is introduced on top of this blockchain is the concept of smart contracts. And the idea of a smart contract is really simply just the idea of having this little script of an application that is on top of the blockchain and that basically enable people to interact not just with other people, but also to interact directly with a machine. So the idea is that we can encode specific conditions, specific obligations and people that transact with those applications, they have no choice but to actually comply with those terms. And the interesting thing is that as we combine multiple of those smart contract, then we can actually create complex system and complex interaction and relationship between people, between people and machines, or between machines and machines in a ways that again always does never require the need for decentralized operator that is dealing with everything. So the idea is really the blockchain is this trustless machine which makes it possible by technology. The trust is delegated away from the central intermediary. It's also not necessary for there to be any trust between the individuals that are interacting with each other. The trust is delegated to the technological system. So as long as people trust that the technology is actually working as it claims to do, then there needs to be no other form of trust in the system."

        "content": "that's a basic overview. I'm happy to go into more detail afterwards with the questions, but we can now look at what are the applications of this new technology. So the most obvious one is obviously financial applications. So after Bitcoin which was the payment system. We can also develop much more sophisticated models, but which are also related on the exchange of value and transaction. So it can go from really the banking system, so the store of value or the exchange of value to remittances. So for instance, with Bitcoin or with other kind of blockchain technology, it is now possible to send money from one country to the other, irrespectively of where are the boundaries. And instead of needing to pay, for instance, like 80 bucks every time someone send money abroad, then practically just like a fraction of a dollar. It is also possible to create system for peer to peer lending and derivatives or security markets, which are essentially just system that because it's mathematical as a whole mathematical operation, it is really easy to encode them into the blockchain, so that this trustless machine can make sure that everything that has been encoded and everything that has been contracted with the other person will always be, will always happen irrespectively of the will of the person. Because once it has been agreed, once the smart contract has been enacted, then the technology, the underlying infrastructure, will make sure that the contract will happen. So this can provide a series of efficiencies, most notably in the derivative and security market, where there is for instance, oftentimes a delay between clearance and settlement. It provides also better accountability because you can actually keep track of every transaction. And so generally today, the most attractive, but also the most practical application of the blockchain is in the context of financial transaction. And there is in fact a lot of banks and financial institutions that are actually exploring the use of those technologies in order to optimize themselves and in order to provide better accountability."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "another field that is really important and that is now currently being explored most notably by IBM, by Samsung, HP, etc. So it's the turning the Internet of Things into the Internet of smart things by encoding specific functionality into objects so that those objects are not just able to communicate with one another, which is already the case with the Internet of Things, but they are also able to exchange to actually create a transaction. So this has two important implications for the Internet things. One is the concept of creating this smart property, which means that we can connect a particular token, a particular transaction on the blockchain to, to have a meaning for a particular object. So for instance, you can imagine that you have a car, and this car is linked to a token, and only the person that actually can prove that it has possession of the token on the blockchain will for instance, be able to activate the car. In the same way, with a telephone, only those people that actually have particular tokens in the blockchain will be able to use the phone, because this is required in order to actually create the phone call. So you can create those assets which are physical assets, but which have a representation in the blockchain. And therefore it becomes possible to interact with assets through the blockchain layer. And then of course the other thing is that all those devices now because they have their own wallet, they have like a bitcoin wallet on a blockchain system, then they are also able to interact with each other and to immediately transactions. So the obvious example is the one provided by Samsung and IBM which are designing these smart fridges and smart washing machines that for instance detect automatically when the SOAP is offered. And they can, on their own, they can create a transaction towards a grocery in order to purchase new things. So whether it's for grocery or soap, etc. Even all we can have the system where you have specific elements, such as for instance, smart locks that will only open to the people that can prove that they have a particular token. So you can imagine new forms of Airbnb where I can rent out my house or I can rent out some objects and they will only be activated with the token. So in this case we don't really need to transfer anything in physical world because the object is itself connected to the blockchain and will react according to the token, that according to who is the owner of the token. So those are all the possible. This is obviously all still speculation. Like everything, the technology is still under development and not really mature yet. But those are all things that are possible in the, in the short term."

        "content": "another thing that I would like to address, which is more of my personal research, and this is actually what is what I consider to be the most interesting in terms of the blockchain, is how it enable new organizational structures which, which significantly differ from what we are used to. I can provide just a short overview of how the organization that we know today have been evolving over time. And we can see how we have moved away from this model, which was essentially mostly centralized, where we had one big operator or an incumbent that was creating value and that was selling products or providing services to a passive public. And slowly with the Internet, we actually moved into this much more centralized, decentralized method of production, where the value is actually no longer produced by decentralized operator, but is actually produced by the user, by the consumers. So whether it's the case of Uber, Airbnb or Facebook, YouTube, et cetera. The value is generated by the user, and then the central operator, the intermediary in this case, is only aggregating this value and is coordinating the individuals in order to then provide a service back to them. And so obviously we can see that there is some kind of clash that emerges in this system, because whereas the value creation is actually created by the user, then the profits are for the most part extracted by those intermediaries. So the question then that, that we would like to raise is how can we actually make those intermediaries obsolete? And how can we actually engineer new system of organization where the value that is produced by the user can actually be given back to those user in a more equal way."

So Bitcoin has shown that it is possible to eliminate the need of financial intermediaries, which is something that is quite difficult to imagine beforehand, because it seems really difficult that people could transact with one another without actually relying on this central clearinghouse. Now, if Bitcoin has managed to that it is possible to operate without financial intermediary in a market context, then the blockchain itself could potentially disintermediate many other field of activities beyond the financial application. And again, this all comes back to this concept of what the economist has defined as the trust machine. So the ability to encode everything that relates to trust directly into the technology itself so that we do no longer need this trusted intermediary. Because when we actually deal with like Airbnb or Uber, etc. The reason why we have this central intermediary is because we need to trust someone, because we don't know the other people. So there is the coordination and there is the trust, and both those functions can actually be fulfilled now with blockchain technology."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I would like to raise an issue which is that indeed there is a lot of discussion that is going on about the advantage and the benefits that are provided by those trustless technologies which enable indeed the creation of trustless transactions with people that do not know each other and therefore do not trust each other. And this is indeed quite useful, most importantly in the case of financial application, in which basically everything that matters is that I know for sure that I'm going to get the money that I'm due. Or in the context, for instance, of the Internet of things, where it is about coordinating and managing devices that need to interact with each other or with people. In any case, there is a situation in which actually trust is a future in which we actually require or we want to find trust into the relations that we have. So when I go into an Airbnb or when I jump into an Uber, I actually want to trust the driver, I want to know that it is a good driver, I want to know that he's not going to try to cheat me, etc. And so when expanding the concept not just into financial education, but into any kind of organization and social relationship, then the trustlessness of the technology actually becomes a problem. And therefore we need to deploy. The more trustless is the technology, the more is the need to actually reintroduce a new layer of trust on top of this trustless technology."

        "content": "this is the reason that motivation to create Backfeed to be better with some colleagues. And the idea with Backfeed is to design a distributed governance system, or to some extent a social operative system for decentralized application. So in which bugfeed relates to the rest of the ecosystem is essentially a little bit as an analogy, which is not a perfect analogy, but I think it actually really clearly convey the meaning is the idea that in 94, before the web was there, then there was the Internet that was still merging and a lot of people were creating a lot of applications, but everyone was actually starting from scratch. There was no single standard protocol on which to deploy applications. So the whole application had to build all the way from the TCP IP up. And because of this, there was actually no interoperability between those applications. And then when the HTTP protocol came up, then it became really simple for anyone to deploy web application on top of this protocol. And the advantage of this is that on the one hand, it's really easy. On the second hand, every web app can communicate with another web app really easily. Now, when we move into the blockchain stack, the situation is a little bit the same today, but we have those basic blockchain layers, like the basic infrastructure, and people are building a lot of application on top of them. But all those applications are reinventing the stack all the time and they are not interoperable with each other. They all use their own tokens, they use their own governance structure, et cetera. So the idea with Buckfeed is actually to design one protocol, one operating system on which it becomes really easy to create new application layer on top of."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Backfeed is basically made of three basic ingredients. So first one is the consensus algorithm, which instead of relying on algorithmically quantifiable actions, such as for instance, proof of work as it used in the Bitcoin, it actually relies on actions that needs to be evaluated by individuals. So is a system of people to evaluate each other on a peer to peer manner and to provide economic rewards according to the perceived value that they have provided to the organization. Then the second ingredient is the reputation system, which is a form of assessing what is the influence of every individual within the organization, so as to enable the emergence of dynamic meritocratic system in which which whoever contributing the most to an organization and whoever is the most aligned with the value system of that organization will have a high of influence. And then finally, the third ingredient is the economic model. So it's the ability for every organization to issue their own tokens and to design a business model around those tokens. So it's the matter of tokenizations that when people contribute value to the organization, they will receive those tokens, and those tokens will become the means for them to actually enjoy the products or the service provided by the community. So contributing gives you free access to the community. Also as long as there are other people that did not contribute to the community, but are interested in actually benefiting from the outcome, from the output of the community, then people have the possibility of selling those tokens on the market and get be rewarded with actual money."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "when we combine those three ingredients together, then it becomes possible to create those so called decentralized collaborative organizations which are borrowing up. So it enabled the spontaneous contribution of people that are essentially just identifying how they can contribute to an organization according what their skills are. And there is no one telling anyone else what to do. Completely spontaneous and emergent. But to add on top of this, and I think this is important in order for this community to actually scale up, it provides economic incentives which are generated. Those are economic incentives that can be provided without having initially the actual funds, because those are generated through the stockings that will only acquire value afterwards when the service actually gains an audience. And in addition to this, the distributed governance structure that is emergent from the influence that the people accumulate while they contribute. So this is, I think, a really interesting model in the sense that on the one hand, it is actually in order to have a decentralized application, in order to actually benefit from the decentralization of an application that blockchain technology provide. It is actually really important to elaborate a distributed governance structure because in some way it doesn't make sense to use to deploy on top of It a centralized governance structure. So those decentralized government are necessary enough to enable the decentralized application, but in fact they can also be used in many other fields. So it doesn't necessarily need to be only for blockchain application. It could actually be implemented in any other kind of organizations."

But it's the concept of decentralized autonomous organ. So as opposed to a decentralized collaborative organization, which is more like a cooperative, which means that it is operated in common by everyone that is actually contributing to it in the context of a decentralized autonomous organization, actually eliminate not just the figure of the intermediary, but we also eliminate the figure of. And this means that those organizations are actually completely independent in the sense that once they have been deployed on top of the bridge, they do no longer need their creators and actually they don't actually need to listen to them, they become independent. And secondly they are in the sense that they can actually charge users for the service that they provide in order to be able eventually to purchase the hustles that they need in order to survive. So of course this sounds a little bit scary to some extent. And the bottom line will be indeed it can be possible to create this kind of like robotic creatures that have acquired a life on their evolve without the human being able to control them anymore. But personally I think that the future looks more like this. I don't know if you have seen this, but this is a very TV show which presented this autonomous car. And the idea is that with the blockchain, with those autonomous at least there is a lot of talk about it. It is possible to create not just self driving cars, but it is actually possible to create autonomous cars that do not belong to anyone. They're actually self owned and they can just drive around and provide some rights to people in exchanges of money. And with this money they can then purchase their own gas or perhaps they can repair themselves. So there's a lot of discussion about all the potentiality that could be done when we incorporate the concept of decentralized autonomous organization with devices or with objects that will then become autonomous devices. Now the problem is that up until now actually I think I have not yet seen, I think even close to the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization."

So an Android is really simply just a robot with human appearance, Whereas a plant then is a robot with some plant characteristics. Right. So how do they actually differ one with another plants? The goal of the plant is to reproduce itself, but many of those plants are not actually able to reproduce themselves on their own. And they require the help of some third party agents, most usually bees or butterflies, in order to actually support them in the reproduction process through pollination. Now, a plantoid is a little bit different because relying on pollination, it relies on capitalization. So it also is not able to reproduce itself on its own. And it requires humans to actually hide them in their reproduction classes. So the plantoid is basically made of two different parts. One thing is the body. So it's a mechanical sculpture that can move and can light up and sometimes does some music. And then there is the spirit or the soul of the plantoid, which itself subsists on the Ethereum blockchain as a smart contract."

So whenever people can, people can send the monitored and the plant might do a little dance, or might do some music, or perhaps do some light show, etc. As an appreciation system. All this to accumulate as many bitcoins as possible so that it will then be able to produce. Then once there is sufficient amount of bitcoin that have been accumulated in a wallet, this triggers the actual reproduction process, which will activate the smart contract within the Ethereum blockchain. And it will open the mating period, which is when humans or individuals, artists, can submit a particular proposal on how they envision the reproduction the new copy of the planet to be. So it's basically just a set of proposals that will be submitted together with the unique identifier which is the bitcoin. And then comes the third phases of reproduction, which is the hiring. So everyone that has actually sent money initially to the plantoid on the bitcoin wallet has now a possibility to vote on who is the favorite proposal that has been submitted. And they can send microtransaction on the bitcoin blockchain to those unique identifier which is the bitcoin address. And that vote will be weighted with the amount of funds that it has sent in the beginning and Then eventually there is some kind of majority, and the plantoid establish who is the winner, who is the artist that has been selected to reproduce the plantoid, and then the planetoid will then create a bitcoin transaction and send the money to that artist so that it will be able to produce a new copy of itself."

But the idea is that every time a planet can reproduce, then it also sends a little bit of the bitcoin that is collected to its original artist and to its parent. And this means that therefore, every artist actually has the highest incentive to produce the best plantoid ever, because the more this plantoid will be able to reproduce and to create little siblings, then the more these artists will actually acquire royalties on top of that. And so in the end, we can see that this creates some kind of evolutionary algorithm where we have different branches of the plantoid that will develop more or less according to whether they are fit to their environment. And people can select what they want to reproduce by deciding who they should actually send the money to."

But the model is actually really interesting because it shows how, in terms of copyright, we can actually shift the focus of copyright, which is still really strongly focused on the artist, where people are sending money to an artist in order for the artist to reproduce new works. Whereas here, because we can actually create those, autonomous, distributed, autonomous organization, we can actually send the money directly to the art, to the art piece, which itself will then choose which artist should be the one to reproduce itself, and which can evolve according to what the community which is surrounding it, decides that is the most valuable to fund. So, of course, my hope with this is actually just to be some form of inspiration and to actually see whether this new model of funding objects in some way can actually be deployed in many other fields of application. And I think one of the most important one will be in the context of community, community based objects, or, you know, maybe like building things within a community and where there is no initial funding to do that, but when the community can actually Crowdfund the money, but the money is actually not hold by anyone but by the actual object that is being produced. And the evolution of how these objects will be depends on what the community wants. So I think I'm done for now.

All those technologies are mostly non experimental phases and I don't think like in terms of scalability, I don't think we are yet at any point in which we can actually deploy this technology on widespread and mainstream usage. There is a lot of research that is going on of course and I suspect that the problem of scalability will eventually be solved in one way or another. The other problem of course we resolve the scalability problem I think is the user adoption. It's actually the understanding of this technology. So it does provide really great opportunities. And I think that's, I mean that's what is driving me most importantly like opportunities on how people can organize themselves differently and what are the new business model or new economic model that can be, that can emerge from this. I think the Main problem that I noticed today, in fact, is that bitcoin as the first application of the blockchain has actually created a strong stigma of the technology. And whenever I speak about the blockchain to people that are actually more in the common based ecosystem, many of them actually have a negative reaction to it because immediately it gets associated to this crypto libertarian vision of bitcoin. And I actually think it's actually quite a pity because it does seem to me that today the people that are the most eager to explore and to experiment with those technologies are actually banks and speculators. But it doesn't mean that this is actually the only that the only opportunity of the technology are limited to this. I think actually it has such fundamental opportunities that could actually really radically modify the way in which we organize ourselves. And the problem is that because there is only one group of people that are actually really jumping on this technology, it's kind of making other people afraid to explore because it gets associated there. So I would say that the second challenge is actually pedagogical and it's about trying to explain to people, to the layman, what is it that they can gain from this technology and why they should actually be themselves as well, exploring and experimenting with those new models without just letting banks doing it."

It's a little bit like the Internet in terms of impact on society in the sense that it presents itself as this amazing technology that can be more emancipatory and provide more individual freedom and coordination. On the other side, I would say that just like the Internet has proved eventually to become this tool of strong surveillance and control, the blockchain, if it actually becomes controlled and co opted by centralized power, it can actually become really dangerous because all these concepts of trustlessness and self execution and self enforcing contract will actually be really great if it's actually used in order to design decentralized governance and decentralized organization, but can actually become quite dangerous when it's being used in order to impose particular contracts on people and like what is today just like a legal contract become an actual technical enforcement. So at the same time, like, we need to be careful about looking at both faces of the technology and understanding that it can be used obviously both for good and for bad, and trying to maximize the good while minimizing the negative side effects."

        "content": "in terms of fablabs, like one really obvious that comes my mind is about the governance and the management of the resources. So a little bit like what I explained for instance, when I was speaking about backfill. So the idea is like, how do you actually understand or decide who can use what machine? When and how do you evaluate the contribution that every individual is actually providing? So of course the blockchain becomes. The blockchain is just a medium. It's just like an interface between people. But it's a useful interface because it enables people to coordinate themselves without having a central operator or a central management. So in the context of fablab, which are indeed mostly like grassroots and bottom up initiatives, I think it can be useful to the extent that you can actually implement a model by which everyone that is contributing to the fablab in whatever way, like it doesn't have to be like predefined, but people can evaluate the contribution that someone is bringing. Sometimes it's because someone is like cleaning up all the time. Sometimes it's because people are bringing material. Perhaps it's because someone is actually really making people happy and like taking care of the moral of people. And then their contribution to the fablab can be evaluated and they can be rewarded with those tokens. But those tokens are actually not. They are not real money. They are tokens that are generated by the fable. But that becomes an indicator of how much contribution has been given. And then those tokens, they have two effects. On the one hand, because I accumulated those tokens, I can then use the machine. I get credits for actually using machines or perhaps for consuming materials. But on the other hand, and I think that's actually the really interesting thing is that those tokens can also be exchange."

        "content": "if I did contribute a lot to a fab lab. And I actually want to, you know, buy some food. I cannot really use this token to buy food, but I can exchange the stock and to someone that did not contribute to the fab lab, but that wants to use the machine and then will give me some money. And so in this way, you create this hybrid system in which people contribute to a community either for ideological reason or for actual selfish reasons, because they want to use what the fablab is providing. But oftentimes in the communities, the problem is that even if I want to contribute a lot, I cannot, because I actually need to pay rent and buy food. I actually need to live in the market system as well. And in this way, you have this hybrid model in which I can actually contribute as much as I can to a particular initiative or to a fab lab, because I know that some of what I accumulate, some of those tokens, I can actually sell them on the market as long as what the fab lab is providing to society is sufficiently valuable for someone to want to purchase those tokens from me. And so you create this kind of, like, circular system in which the more you contribute to the fablab, the more the fablab is valuable. Right? The more I bring things, the more I bring machine or material, the more the value that is provided by the fablab will be higher in the eyes of authors, and therefore, the higher will the value of those tokens be. And so it creates a positive cycle in which people actually are encouraged to contribute more and more in order to collect more tokens and in order to increase the value of those tokens so that they can then rip off economic returns from this as well."

So we have those big corporations that are doing it, but it's not really transparent what they're doing. And I think that in the same way as, like, you know, the. The open hardware community has managed to actually create really great things, it's really important that we actually work in an open manner and in, like, in a collaborative manner, because those technologies are, like, really complicated, first of all. But it's also something that not a single person can solve. And most importantly, we don't want one corporation to have like, you know, thousands of patents on something and then people cannot profit from this invention anymore. So I think it's really, it will be amazing like if fablab start, you know, experimenting and trying to develop little devices and you know, just, just do whatever, whatever comes to mind. And oftentimes I think that the beauty of this and is actually illustrated by the plant. Like I think the, the reason why there is no dao, there is no decentralized autonomous organization today is actually because it makes no sense. It makes no economic sense, it makes no technical sense and it makes no legal sense because normal people are actually completely constrained by the limits of their work. So an entrepreneur needs to have return on investment and an engineer needs to make something that is functional or meaningful. As an artist, you can actually explore and you can actually push the boundaries of the technology because you can make things without being constrained by the limits of what you're doing. And that's why I think the Fab Lab actually can provide innovation because they can actually experiment and push the boundaries even where it makes no sense yet. But eventually it will actually make sense. Right."

        "content": "Well, I think it's difficult to answer because I think it's really important to distinguish between Bitcoin or virtual currencies and blockchain, of course, virtual currency are now a hot topic as to how we should regulate them, whether we should regulate them and how, most notably because of like, you know, all the problem that in terms of taxation and money laundering and etc. That are associated with Bitcoin. On the other hand, I think that blockchain technology as a technology is completely different. It's like. So it's the danger of regulating a technology which is a very widespread and horizontal form of innovation that can be deployed into so many different fields, and the danger to regulate it with only one particular application in mind, which is virtual currency actually has the danger of eliminating the potential that the other application of the technology can actually bring. So at the moment in the US there is like a lot of regulation which I personally don't think is suitable for this technology. Now there is a new hop. There was just like two weeks ago a public hearing at the European Parliament to figure out how and whether to regulate those technologies. And I would say that actually in Europe, I think that the regulators are actually much more aware of the fact that the technology is broad and that it's more than bitcoin and that any regulation should actually take into account this. So I don't think there is any, any country that is specifically more friendly, because I think at the moment the most friendly is the one that has not regulated it yet. But the main danger is really that this technology is, it's a new technology that is not really well understood by the legal system. And the problem is that it looks like so many things, but it's not exactly any of those. And so you can regulate, you can regulate the blockchain as a currency because of bitcoin. You can regulate it as a security because it looks a little bit like equity. You can regulate it just like a value added community, etc. So it's really complicated because if you're a startup or if you're an organization that is working in this field, you're actually subject potentially to so many regulation that it becomes really, really difficult to operate. And so the problem I think at the moment is to figure out how to define this and how to actually frame every single different application of this technology and not actually look at the blockchain as one thing that needs to regulate it according to one way. We need to look at what are the different verticals that it enables. But the problem is that at the moment we don't really know them because it's still really emergent. So it's really difficult to regulate something that not exist yet."

        "content": "Well, there is a few projects actually that are dealing with the supply chain. There is for instance, the project provenance, which is associating every object that is part of the supply chain with a particular token so that you can actually follow them up. You can follow exactly where the provenance and where are they actually traveling all along the supply chain. So that's one possibility I'm not sure in terms of. In terms of what you're asking to. Yeah, so I don't think I can change necessarily the dependency, but you definitely can obtain better transparency. So for instance, with the provenance project, what you can do is that whenever you encounter a project, you can see where it comes from and see what it is made of and where what is made of also come from. And you can actually make an informed choice. And for instance, you could decide, actually I only want to purchase or to deal with projects that have a particular provenance, or I don't want to deal with those that have this provenance. So you obtain the ability to actually follow up. You get a better accountability of who is dealing with what. Doesn't necessarily mean that you get freedom. I don't think the blockchain can really deal with that, but it can at least make it more visible."
