So I guess I don't need to go much in details, but since a few months, one year, we have like this kind of explosion of adoption of non fungible tokens in the art world and we have like a bunch of very beautiful and interesting artworks that are selling for quite a few million dollars."

One is the question of ownership. So, so what does it actually mean to own an nft? Second is the question of authorship. So who is the author of an NFT and what kind of rights are associated to that? Then the question of digital scarcity. So can we actually, and how do we guarantee the uniqueness of digital copies of digital artworks? And then finally the question of intellectual property and the various recourses that are or are not available in the case of, of possible misuses of NFTs."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "first of all, the question of ownership. So what does it actually mean to own an nft? So in the context of a digital artwork, the notion of ownership was only inherently associated with the notion of intellectual property. So you cannot really own a digital work, but you can own the copyright in the digital work. When we move into the NFT space, then we create for the first time the possibility of actually owning at least a particular digital copy of an artwork."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "actually the notion of ownership is kind of strange because you're still not owning the digital file. You're basically just having a proof of ownership of this concept that is a unique copy of a digital file. And that's what the NFT is about."

        "content": "Now there is also the interesting question is like actually when you own an nft, because your private key is controlling this nft, you're not really possessing necessarily a digital copy of the artwork. And so there is all this question of digital preservation, meaning that me as the owner of an nft, I also want to make sure that the digital work that is associated with my NFT remains accessible so that I can prove that I own these digital file."

But of course we never know when those digital platform will close down, are bankrupt, and not take care of the preservation anymore. We have of course, the IPFS or other decentralized storage systems. But once again, there needs to be sufficient incentives for the various nodes to actually host the digital copy. And so when I own the nft, I cannot have the guarantee, unless I am myself responsible for maintaining a digital copy of the work that is associated, that this work will remain available."

So there is a variety of platforms which, when I acquire the nft, then they ensure that the copyright owner of the image associated is licensing some rights. So usually it's like the right of displaying it on my social media or on some virtual galleries, potentially on my own website and so forth. But again, this always comes because there is an actual copyright license that comes from the copyright holder and that is given to the owner of the nft."

Now the problem is that more and more everyone is trying to create NFTs, and we can see how people are just literally going on the Internet and taking any picture available, remixing it or not remixing it, and then dropping it as an NFT event, though they are not actually the author of this nft."

And no one seems to have managed to take them down or complain. We have the crypto funks, which are basically a flipped version of the cryptopunks. So again, that's. Is that fair use? Is that a legitimate remix? That's open to question, but so they, those can still be purchased"

Well, copyright is a complex one because usually we would rely on copyright infringement to claim that those are not sufficiently original in order to qualify as fair use. The problem is that copyright require a reproduction of the expression of the work. And the NFT does not actually incorporate any images. They just incorporate the hash of a particular digital file."
