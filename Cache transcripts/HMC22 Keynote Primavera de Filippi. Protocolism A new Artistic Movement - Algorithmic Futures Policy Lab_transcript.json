As you see, the Senres has a lot of efforts on this type of questions. She's also associated to Harvard at the Berkman Klein center for Internet and Society. And we know Primavera since a long time now. Now, Primavera works a lot on legal issues that are related to artificial intelligence and more generally computer science. So she's associated to a research center which is mainly focusing on law and political science. And she's very much. Her research focuses on blockchain issues and how this impacts activities that have to do with. All of us is also an artist. You notice that we have a lot of interest in on art in this workshop. So this is one of the reasons for which Primavera is connected to that. And she's going to talk us about Primavera, correct me, Plantoid, which I don't know what it is, but I will explain everything about it and we will be very happy to hear you have the floor. Do you hear us?"

So copyright law, which is the main regulatory framework that is dealing with artistic creation, is based on three fundamental pillars. So the first one is the author. There needs to be an author to create a work. Second is the process of creation, which needs to originate from the author and needs to be original in that way. And then finally there is the work. What is the work that then copyright is providing protection to. And so we're going to look at all those three pillars and see how technology is actually changing a little bit, the status quo."

And so in some way, instead of seeing reproduction as something bad, that is like free riding on the work of the artist, in this case, you're actually supporting the artist into instantiating more and more work into the world. Because every single reproduction of the protocol into a new piece is actually increasing the amount the body of work that the original protocolist artists had, because every single one of those reproductions are a new production and that incorporates the personality of the author."

Whereas here the point is for every artist that creates a plantoid to maximize the dissemination of the plantoid, because the more visible they are, the more they are likely to collect cryptocurrencies, but also to encourage the remix and the creation of derivative works. Because the more the plant reproduces itself, the more the artist will actually earn royalty from it. Because every time a plant is reproduced, there is like some percentage of the reproduction price that goes back to the Original art artist. And so again, why this is interesting."

So who has a question? I will start with a question which is more a curiosity now. Fifty years ago, Xenakis introduced the notion of random music. So instead of writing a piece of music, he wrote an algorithm which generates music randomly. Would that belong, according to your definition, to a protocolist art creation?"

But nevertheless, every single piece of music that it is performed is never similar to the previous ones because part of the melody is randomly generated. No. So, yeah, generator I mean, you just have to know. So there is a protocol, and it is very, very specific on how this is done. But the artwork is not unique."

        "role": "assistant",

Protocol is art where you're leveraging a machine to work to reproduce your protocol according to its own discretionary. And in this case, randomness would be the discretionary power given to the machine to express its own creativity. I guess. So, yeah, I think most generative art art will be falling within the protocolist field."

If the protocol is so distinctive that you keep recognizing every single one of those pieces as belonging to the same family of works that are stemming from the same protocol. So if it's so random and if it's like the constraints are so loose, that is just like random noise, that will then be protocol is. Whereas if the constraints are such that whatever the random is stemming, you can still recognize that it's that protocol that is into play in order to generate the artwork. So again, it's like the outcome of the work counts as an artwork, but does it also incarnate the protocol in a way that you will recognize the protocol as well? And then in that case, we are into the realm of protocolist art. If you cannot recognize the protocol because it's too loose, and so any kind of like random generated thing will be generated, but you cannot recognize that it comes from the same family, then it probably will not be protocolist."

When I give a prompt, I'm usually surprised, but I gave the prompt and if my prompt is sufficiently original and managed to transpire through the output, then it is my work."

In the case of humans, human generated works, I have a protocol, I have the instruction. Like Sollyweight is a very good example. When Solilwit writes an instruction and someone else on the other side of the world implements instruction in order to create a soliloit work, it is actually a soliloit work. It is going to be exposed in a gallery as soliloit."

And through this thing of protocolism enable the asynchronous co authorship of work between people that don't know each other. Thank you."
