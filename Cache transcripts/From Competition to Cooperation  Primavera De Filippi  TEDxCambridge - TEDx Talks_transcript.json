        "content": "Have you ever wondered, how do ants always seem to find the shortest path to a food source? How do termites coordinate themselves in order to build those large monstrous. How do birds navigate and organize themselves into a swarm? Some people regard this as collective intelligence, although there is no real intelligence behind this. Those creatures coordinate themselves indirectly by leaving traces into their own environment so that others can eventually act upon it. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, termites are not even aware of each other. They are genetically designed to be attracted by each other's pheromones, so that they are unconsciously driven to cooperate in order to build those large and impressive mud structures where they live. And so, by aggregating the work of many small, independent agents, nature enables the creation of complex and sophisticated structures whose value is often much larger than the sum of its parts."

Whenever we need to achieve a complex task that requires the participation of many people, we constantly organize ourselves into large scale organizations, companies and corporations in order to do things that we will never be able to achieve as individuals alone. But there is one fundamental difference between the way in which ants and termites operate and the way in which we organize ourselves."

Think about everything we managed to achieve with recent advances in science and technology. Those are all great achievements which we could only do collectively as a society. But none of those achievements were the result of of collective intelligence. Pyramids were built by thousands of slaves serving powerful godlike individuals. And in the same way, today, most companies and organizations are managed by a few powerful individuals who are competing to control and direct the work of others."

When brought to an extreme, competition can in fact lead to an extremely inefficient allocation of resources. And the best example for that is perhaps the case of pharmaceutical companies, which are constantly duplicating efforts and investment in order to be the first one to discover a new drug. And those that do will be the only one that can Patent it, while the advancement of authors will just go to waste."

And I believe that today's social framework, based on hierarchies and competition, is not the only way that we can organize ourselves. Imagine for a moment if people could coordinate themselves in, in a much more organic and distributed manner, just like ants, but without giving up on the complexity and the free will that is characteristic of human societies."

Now, we didn't get that chance, but technology has enabled us to achieve quite a similar outcome. We can now fly faster than any other birds, and we can travel around the globe in the matter of a few hours. My question then is how can we leverage technology in order to simulate the way ants and termites operate and transpose it in the context of much more complex and sophisticated human organizations?"

But Bitcoin is only one out of many possible applications of this new technology. And today, already people are building new blockchain based applications, such as decentralized social networks or decentralized marketplaces that do not require any central authority to coordinate the network. It is instead the underlying technology, the blockchain, that stipulates precisely how people can interact with each other. And those rules are not imposed by any given entity. They are collectively agreed upon by the network as a whole."

It was back then quite difficult, if not impossible, to foresee that one day, not too far away, people would be able to communicate with each other almost instantaneously and on a global scale. That people would be able to broadcast themselves to the world and to interact with one another on a peer to peer basis, bypassing most of the intermediaries of that time. Today, the blockchain is marking the beginning of a new digital revolution whose focus is not just communication, but rather human interaction and cooperation. What the Internet has done to achieve global interpersonal communication, the blockchain could do today to achieve global and systematic collaboration."

And the most beautiful aspect of that is that this kind of open source and large scale collaboration can lead to a positive feedback loop as it acquires a gravitational force that people are naturally attracted to, so that the greater is the number of people collaborating towards a common goal, the harder it becomes for others to stay away or even to compete against it."

The problem is that given the current payoff structure of modern societies, competition is too today the dominant strategy. But it doesn't have to be that way. We now have tools that can help us work together and collaborate on a global scale. And if we can properly deploy those tools, we could actually make cooperation a much more profitable strategy than competition. If in the past we had to compete in order to survive, tomorrow, perhaps we could collaborate instead."

        "content": "let me ask you one favor. Next time you find yourself in a situation in which you feel obliged to compete with your own peers, a situation in which you feel crushed by competitive dynamics, remember that it does not have to be that way. Remember that cooperation can lead to much better results than competition if only it can be properly orchestrated. And this is exactly what the blockchain provides. The blockchain is a technology that relies on a community, and you could be part of this community. There is an opportunity today for all of us to contribute in shaping the future of this new technology. And perhaps together we could actually find ways to use it in order to move away from the old paradigm of competition towards the new paradigm of cooperation. Thank you."
