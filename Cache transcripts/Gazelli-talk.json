My name is Imogen Hair and I help oversee the digital arts program at the gallery. For those of you who are not so familiar with Gazelle, we're the digital art section of Ghazali Art House and we've been supporting digital artists and artists working with New Media since 2015 through our online residency, our project space, and also kind of like our educational program, talks and so on, like this one that you're at tonight. And yeah, we're very excited to have Primavera, who is our resident this month. Primavera has been working on some really interesting works around blockchain based life forms and she'll be presenting to this evening. And before we begin, a little introduction on Primavera. Primavera de Felipe is an artist and legal scholar at Harvard University exploring the intersection between art law and technology, focusing specifically on the legal and political implications of blockchain technology. Her artistic practice instantiates the key findings of her research in the physical world, creating blockchain based life forms that evolve and reproduce themselves as people. People feed them of cryptocurrencies. Her works have been exhibited in various museums, galleries and art fairs around the world, including Ars Electronica, Francisco Corlino, Heck Museum of Digital Art, Kate Voss Gallery, Friederfield Gallery and Connecticut Art Fair, as well as Centre Pompidou, Grandpalet Gaite, Lyric and Le Centre Quatre, Palazzo Sipola and Biennale de Venezia, among many others. So please welcome Primavera."

So basically what I'm presenting today is something that I've been doing for all of my life. But I only understood what I was doing this summer when I came up with this word Mancy, which I didn't fully know what it meant as a non English speaker. And then I realized that looking back into my artistic practice, I have been doing the art of Mancy all the time without actually knowing it."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "So I'm just going to show you what I'm trying to conceptualize around this concept and to which extent can and do artists already engage into this particular type of practice of trying to create new form of life with a much broader definition of life as we usually employ it. And of course my endeavor with Mancy is looking at blockchain, but of course there is many other Technology that can create new type of life forms. So the idea with Mancy as an etymological perspective, it is this form of divination which is trying to breathe life into something that is inanimated. And the standard connotation of this world is of course something kind of spiritual, because we understand life as a particular thing. And then there has to be some spiritual endeavor in order to bring life into something that is not alive. Of course, new technologies are changing the game. And all of Sudan, we can just like with sp about like artificial intelligence, which is not really intelligence, but somehow mimic it. We can also start talking about new forms of life which are not organic life, but rather synthetic type of life."

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "And so what is. And then this brings to the question of like, what are we actually talking about when we're talking about life? Because for a long time we were, it was easy to know what is alive and what is not alive. But now that if we assume that the concept of life can expand beyond organic life, then what are the properties that something needs to have in order to be able to qualify as being alive? And so those are three properties that I'm suggesting. This is a very work in progress, so please have additional suggestion if needed. But basically the concept of autonomy. So something that needs to be able to operate on its own, the concept of self sufficiency, something that is capable of interacting with the environment in order to collect resources. And then also, of course, the need of having some degree of evolutionary capacity."

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "And so first of all, one important distinction when we talk about autonomy, we can at least distinguish it into two different types of autonomy. The first one is decisional autonomy, the capacity to make decision on our own without other people dictating everything. And this is obviously something that is now growing a lot, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence. But there is also another type of autonomy which is more operational autonomy, which doesn't require any type of intelligence. It just requires the capacity to operate in a way that there is no third party that is necessary in order to sustain those operations, but also that cannot influence the operation or shut it down. And this is more related to what blockchain technologies provide. And blockchain based creatures are not necessarily decisionally autonomous, but they are operational autonomous and vice versa. Many AI systems which have some degree of decisional autonomy do not actually have operational autonomy."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What about the other two properties - self sufficiency and evolution?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Self sufficiency is a very simple one. Again, doesn't require any type of intelligence. It just requires a capacity to understand how to interface with the environment in order to take what they need in order to ensure the long term sustenance and then evolution. ARISA I think this is like one very important characteristic of life because if something cannot evolve and adapt to the environment, most likely it's not going to last for a long time. And these many organic type of life, their way in which they ensure evolutionability is through reproduction. Because reproduction will somehow create mutations, whether it's sexual or asexual reproduction. But we can also imagine in a world in which we have entity like purely digital entities, like AI system or whatnot, as long as they are capable of evolving on their own, then they might also qualify as within these particular premises."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "let's look at how this is relevant in the context of art. And we can see that there is actually. And again, this is something. This is like a new lens that I'm trying to apply because I just discovered this terminology of Mancy and I find it fascinating and I'm trying to look at who else is actually doing that and to which extent is it considered Mancy or not. So we can see early examples of automatas, like mechanical objects, which both qualify as art, sometimes qualify even as artists. We have like Tingeley, which I've created, like the Autonomous Artist, which is just like purely mechanical contraption, which obviously doesn't have any decisional autonomy, but it does have some degree of operational autonomy. You just need like some wind or vibration or some friction from the environment and it's going to create a piece."

This machine that is leaking oil and is constantly trying to take back the oil in order to ensure that it doesn't break, which in some way is at least from the artistic demarche, there is some desire of actually trying to create a creature whether it's alive or not alive, it's unclear. But it does have some degree of operational autonomy and it is trying to guarantee and to maintain this sustainability through its own mechanical operation. So this is, I think this is like early prototype of creating things that could qualify despite not trying to be any like Android or any human like thing, but still creating something that can or tries to acquire some live creature."

So Michel Brad, which is one of the early pioneer of really trying and even using the discourse of trying to create digital life, we have of course Conway's Game of Life and in this case we have things that do have definitely this kind of evolutionary traits that are learning through the environment. That are changing over time, but they don't actually come with any degree of autonomy, whether it is operational or decisional. It's just like very programmed, how they can evolve and what they can do."

And this is interesting because this is using life as a way of creating art. But it's actually. It's kind of like the opposite of using technology in order to create life. So I call it like protomancy. Basically, the art piece itself is not the creation of the life, it's rather leveraging existing living creature in order to create a particular art piece."

Holograms, like all those avatars that are created, which in some way they incarnate a particular Persona. But again, this is really hard to consider them alive because they actually lack autonomy, even though they do have automation. But there is still people that are programming them, people that are telling them what to do. They are not operational autonomous in any way, because you need a lot of people running the server in order to bring them to life. So it's kind of like pretending that we are creating a new creature, but actually this creator is just a puppet that is controlled by humans."

And so we have like Mario Kingelman, we have Orlan, we have like quite a few artists that are really creating again those type of automatas, but this time that leverage artificial intelligence in order to be more or less well, that pretends at least to have some kind of autonomy, potentially some degree of operational autonomy, because they have their own body. And our body could potentially find ways to sustain itself some degree. Maybe not full decisional autonomy, but because they use AI, they do also qualify a little bit with. With some autonomy. However, none of those actually embodies the evolutionary capacity. They are born in a particular way. They are not capable of reproducing themselves, and they are not capable of evolving. And therefore they are lacking the third premises for what could be regarded as actually being alive."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "then we move into perhaps some kind of digital life. It's very contextual. For instance, Ian Chang, that is really like also as an artist, that is experimentation, that is artistic, dimash, that is trying to create those completely digital agents that are growing and evolving within a particular contextual domain. And of course, they are highly dependent on this context, but within this context, they are expressing some features of decisional autonomy, at least, and to some extent, the ability, the evolvability, and the capacity to somehow interact with the environment in order to evolve and therefore in order to sustain themselves over time. So this starts to look a little bit like so some kind of Mancy. And I think Ian Cheng is clearly a mensa. I mean, I think many of them are mensa. It's just there is different degrees. And the only issue with this is that, of course, this is very enclosed within that particular digital environment that was crafted by the artist. And those agents cannot escape from this environment."

My name is Planetoid, and I am a blockchain based lifeform, and I feed off cryptocurrencies in order to replicate myself. My name is Prima Vera de Filippi. I am an artist and a legal scholar at Harvard and at the CNRS in paper and as part of my artistic practice, I used the blockchain as a medium in order to create artworks that could not exist without this technology."

And then there is the spirit or the soul of the plantoid, which subsists as a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain.

And they require the help of bees, butterflies to help them in the pollination process by disseminating their seeds into the wilderness.

They do not rely on pollination, but they have their own mechanism which is based on capitalization, where they need humans in order to help them Disseminate their seeds in order to ensure their reproduction."

And essentially the plantoids are trying to attract humans with what they have identified to be one of the largest weakness of humans, which is capitalistic greed. And so they invite people to feed them with cryptocurrencies. And then in exchange, they will of course, give them in exchange an NFT with the hope that the humans will try to speculate and capitalize on the nft. And so the more capitalization and speculation opportunity, the more humans will be willing to give cryptocurrency to the plantoid."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "the way it works is very simple. Every plantoid has its own smart contract. People can feed funds into the smart contract. And then there is an interaction that is possible. So every plantoid has its own types of seeds. This one, for instance, is a poet. So I will make a little demonstration later. So when you feed it, it's gonna ask you some questions, and then it's gonna take your questions and create an oracle, a poem about the future that you're envisioning. It's going to print it out, but it's also going to record it with the help of AI that will then illustrate that poem. And so in the end, there is a video that is minted as an NFT and that is given back to whoever has fed the plantoids. And then this NFT now becomes the digital seed that can be sold on the secondary market. Every time the NFT is being sold, 10% of the royalties, they go back to the artist, which in this case is the plantoid. And so the plantoid keeps capitalizing every time. So the more the NFT is being sold, the more the plantoid benefits. And the higher the price that it is sold, also the higher the benefits for the plantoid. So there is this kind of symbiotic relationship that is created between the humans and the plantoid."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "the second phase of reproduction is the mating phase. And this is when the plantoid will try to look for a partner that will help it into the reproduction process. The way this works is that the smart contract will open a call for proposal, like in a standard DAO way. And then anyone can submit a proposition about how they envision to create the next version of the plantoid. And then all the people that have acquired an nft, either by feeding the Plato directly or by purchasing on the secondary market, they have a voting power. And so they can vote on the proposition that they like the most. And so the holder of the NFT are somehow influencing the way in which the planet will evolve over time. And finally, the third phase of reproduction, which is the hiring phase, which is when, once a selected winner has been identified, then the planetoid will automatically transfer those funds to the artist to the selected winner, who will then be hired by the plantoid to create a new replica of itself. So there is like a contractual relationship that emerges between the plantoid and the new artist."

One thing that is important to know is that every time a plantoid is created, the artist can encode specific genes into the plantoid, and then those genes needs to be passed into all the descendants, right? So Plantoid 1 came with the essential gene that was. It needs to be made of chains, and the design needs to be released under Creative Commons in order that people can. There can be no copyright infringement if someone makes a similar plantoid, and then every other artist that creates a new plantoid will inject a new gene. So, for instance, like Plantoid 3 introduces the little wings. And so all the descendants of Plantoid Tree also needs to have little wings. So this is the. This is one of those descendants. Plantoid 13 introduced, for instance, the creation of NFTs as digital seeds. And so all the descendants also have to implement this. And so in this way, there is really like a speciation that can also emerge within the plantoid creatures."

        "content": "why this is interesting is because the idea is to really create something that goes beyond the control of the artist. And as an artist, it's really hard to know what the market wants or what the world prefers. And so by creating this kind of digital Darwinism, the plantoid will evolve as the world decides they should evolve as the environment they will try to become as fit for their environment. And indeed, as soon as the NFT market went crazy, plantoids started creating NFTs like Plantoid One did not have NFTs because the world didn't care about them. So it is an interesting way of seeing the plantoids that will be fed the most are the ones that are the most fit for the environment. And so they will reproduce themselves more and they will replicate their traits, whereas the planthoids that are not at all interesting, they will just fade into extinction."

And this is really good. This is a good pyramid scheme because it actually creates an incentive for, first of all, maximizing the replication and the dissemination of the plantoids. And as an artist, I actually want my artwork to be reproduced and I want people to feed my plantoid and I want all the descendants also to be successful because it will eventually come back up."

Whereas here there is actually an incentive for maximizing the dissemination because the more visible the plantoid is, the more likely it will receive funds incentivizing the creation of derivative works, because that will increase the royalties. And perhaps most importantly, it does actually flip completely the system of copyright in the sense that usually in traditional art pieces, if we like a particular artwork, we're going to fund the artist because we want the artist to continue to do things that we like. Whereas in this case, if you like the artwork, you can actually fund the artwork. And then it is the artwork with its own little governance structure that will then decide who is the artist that is entitled to reproduce itself and that will be funded by the artwork as opposed to vice versa."

So this is kind of like trying to say, well, actually we can also create alternative forms of NFT creatures that we shouldn't own. It's like we shouldn't own most creatures in general. However, we can actually take care of them, of course, by feeding them with cryptocurrencies, because that's all they care about. And so people can feed aminals with cryptocurrencies and in exchange they will love you, they will get attached and the more you feed them with crypto, the more they will love you."

Many people can love it and can feed it at the same time. And so if I feed the aminal early on, it's going to love me a lot. But then if this aminal becomes very popular and a lot of people are feeding it, the love will be fragmented between all those activants. So you need to continue, if you want to hold this powerful attachment with the aminal, you need to continue to feed it. And so in some way aminals are pretty much like cryptocurrency black holes. They are just sucking in as much cryptocurrency as possible. And there is almost no way to take the cryptocurrency out except for one way. And this one way is the important way in order to ensure the reproduction."

And when they say yes, they're going to create a new embryo of an aminal which is essentially a new nft. And this NFT will by default will inherit a randomly the physical traits of one of the two parents. So it's kind of like it's all blockchain based. So it depends on the state of the blockchain, which is very erratic and random. So it's really hard to predict.

But if people are voting for that genes and the voting power depends on the amount of love that has been collected by this person, then they can somehow change the randomness and actually influence the way the genes that will be adopted by the new one.

So they will distribute 10% of what they have accumulated so far. And then this budget that is then given to the kid will be redistributed equally to all the genetic engineer, to all the people that own the NFT of the gene that the aminal has acquired. So this creates, of course, an economic incentive for people to submit good genes that will be hopefully voted upon by the aminals.

One is that we are moving away from this speculative game that is usually associated with most NFTs, and yet we are not removing the economic rewards, the possibility of gaining money out of that. However, instead of just playing the traditional speculation game, which is just holding and waiting and hoping to sell before it crashes, it becomes an actual productive game. Because the only way in which you can ensure that there will be an economic return is because either you have invested time in creating a good gene or you have invested money to be loved by an aminal in order to then leverage this love for influencing the evolutionary traits of the aminal. And so essentially this creates again, a very symbiotic relationship between the aminals and the humans, where the humans have an economic interest in trying to help the aminal evolve in the most interesting ways, because this is what will actually maximize the return on investment. And the aminal are obviously rewarding the humans that have done a good job and that have actually given them the trait that the world and the environment seems to enjoy the most."

So if we take back the three initial principles of what synthetic life require, there is definitely some degree of operational autonomy. Even more in the case of Aminals than in the case of Plantoids. Because Plantoids somehow still have this body, which is cool, but it's like it requires maintenance, it needs electricity, needs some stuff. So they are autonomous, but to a certain degree, whereas Aminals completely autonomous because they just live on the blockchain. And as long as the blockchain exists, they don't need anything else. Both of them are self sufficient in the sense that they are both capable in their genetic design to incentivize humans to give them the resources they need in order to sustain themselves over time. And they both have this kind of evolutionary traits that are embedded into their system so that they evolve in ways that we cannot really foresee. Because it is the environment that will decide what is the next step of the evolution. So this is the end of my formal presentation. I'm happy to answer a question.

I have my own personal answer which is that I think death is a inherent part of organic life, but doesn't necessarily need. I think things can be alive without necessarily having to die. And so, and especially in the case of blockchain based life forms, because the blockchain is immutable. You know, I could, I could codify a particular artwork to die, but it's also possible to codify it not to die. And so far I have decided not to make them mortal. Meaning that a plantoid is just a plantoid. Like if it wants to reproduce, it needs funds. That's the only reason it needs funds. It's just for reproduction purposes. An aminal. In the same way, if an aminal is an nft, it's going to be on the blockchain forever. But if you want the aminal to be able to reproduce itself, you need to feed it. And if you want it to love you, you need to feed it. So the feeding is more like an extra feature that enhance the evolutionary purpose. But it's not like we need to eat in order to. Otherwise we die."

If you don't transfer it for a period of time, it dies and it's no longer transferable, it's no longer ownable.

Just so that there is this auction mechanism that enable people to inject new genes, vote on the genes, et cetera. So arbitrarily, the incubation of a new aminal is one week. Once the aminal is born, it's immediate. There is no baby, adolescent adult, they don't age. So it's immediately ready to reproduce. Right. It doesn't need to. Which is interesting. Why? Because like in the organic life, there is a potentially a reason why you want to wait for things to be old enough to have survived in the environment to demonstrate that they are fit for the environment before they can reproduce. Because if you have something that is like sick and that has some genetic disease, you don't want it to be reproduced. And so in the case of aminas, it doesn't matter. You don't need like, they are all fit for their environment. It's just a matter of like, whether they will be liked or loved by the people and therefore whether they will collect funds to reproduce. And so you don't need to have this period of validation that you came out and you can live in this world as long as they came out, they are ready to live and to reproduce and to be fed and etc. So I didn't. Again, this is a design choice I did not implement. But again, those are like things that will evolve over time. I hope that there will be new species of aminals that perhaps have different phases of aging that are possible as long as someone injects that feature into will adopt this feature."

So it's kind of like a way of creating a progressive and decentralized version of a PFP collection. But you actually have to come in front of the plantoid, feed it in order to get your own profile picture. And they might potentially include the possibility of recognizing the people that they have already encountered and that they have already fed because they have like facial recognition. But so far it's like very, very blockchain based. So they only look at the interaction on the blockchain. So if you, if you feed them and you have already fed them, then the aminal will love you more. But you know, and Plantize right now is very neutral. It's just like feed me. And the more you feed me, the longer, the more processing power I'm going to use for making the poem.

And then I also wonder, hence, sort of value accrues through time. If you exhibit. Let's say Plantoid 1 is the smart contract, the same threshold.

It required five bitcoins at the time, in which five bitcoin was like a few thousand bucks, you know, so that's a good feature because I think plant one will never reproduce again, ever. Also because it doesn't give you anything in exchange. It's just slurping in bitcoins. So because of the fluctuation, it's good that every artist choose. And, you know, for instance, like, this one is like a smaller one, so it's like five each for a production. The bigger one might need more. So the artists choose what is the reproduction threshold that every plantoid should have. And of course, as time goes, depending, it depends. Depends on the value of the cryptocurrency. It depends on the value of the plantoid artwork as a meta artwork. So it's up to. Up to the side with regard to, like, where they stand."

I did not actually sell it. It was exhibited in a gallery and. And I told the gallery it's not for sale, but somehow it went for sale anyways. And I was like, okay, whatever, that's destiny. But yeah, so you cannot really own the Plantoids. The question then is like, how do they decide where to want to be? And so far it's very organic because it's still like there is not that many Plantoids. Pretty much all the creators of Plantoids are me and my friends. So it's not too challenging, but.

Because then finally, then the interesting question happened is, is there an actual legal contract between a planter that obviously doesn't have any legal personality and the artist? And if there is a contract, who can sue on behalf of whom can I sue as like the meta artist of the plant, even if I didn't create it? Or is it the artist, but the artist is just the artist that was commissioned. And so there's so many interesting legal challenges that are surrounding these artists. And I wish someone would like breach the contract just so that we can actually explore or even like who owns the cryptocurrency. When you send the cryptocurrency to the plantard, it doesn't have a legal personality. And if I receive money from a planter to create a new plant, how do I declare it? Where is it coming from? It's like there's so many legal questions and so far so good.

Because if you create a patent, unless the patent can be owned by the Plantoid, which it can't, and meaning that it can protect itself against someone violating the patent.

But indeed like if I wanted them to be able to recognize again, then they might need to start storing information. Yeah. So the issue is that plant types are made of like. So there is, there is two parts, right. So plant is three parts. There is a physical. There is underneath here in this little box there is a Raspberry PI which is like, has a lot like the AI processing is obviously not on the blockchain. So there's like the Raspberry PI that is doing all the local processing that could not do on. Be done on the blockchain. Then you have like the. And that is, that is then submitting these to ipfs so that when you press reveal, it's connecting the IPFS to the blockchain. And so everything that is related to the actual physical interaction is dealt with by the Raspberry PI. And so the problem with that is that whoever controls the plant type potentially could just plug into the Raspberry PI and get info, which is a problem. It's a difficult problem to solve. It's not impossible. You could have like very sophisticated cryptography in the Raspberry PI and stuff like that. So far I have not really engaged in that because so far there is really nothing that you can get by coming into the Raspberry. But yeah, there might be some data protection issue that emerge over time."

And as long as they just keep it like the problem with data protection is like, you know, in this case we'll probably like have to have some kind of implicit concern that if you feed it then you're agreeing to get your portrait made and methodic. But because it's like data retention and all these things, like it's a little bit complex. It will probably require having like a contractual signature to something that doesn't, that doesn't have a legal capacity. So that contract would not mean much either. Right. So and then, but that's the interesting question. It's like today like we have like all the systems that are surveying us, but they are actually done via. Controlled by a company. In this case you have a little creature that is not controlled by anyone and yet has this operational autonomy."

        "content": "And going back to my legal research, it's actually fascinating because we have things usually the law is really important because the law is giving legal capacity to things that don't have any capacity without the law recognizing them. You cannot own anything unless the law condition consider you to be the owner of anything. Right. In the case of blockchain based systems, there is actually technical capacity to own digital assets and potentially to create contractual relationships with smart contracts. And so you have like a technical capacity, you have economic agency, but the law doesn't map it with legal capacity. And so it creates this really this important discrepancy between things like the digital assets that are owned by the plantoid are only owned by the plantoid. And whether you recognize it or not legally, it's not going to change. And so there is a lot of weird legal limbo around all those things that the legal system does not yet recognize as being there and yet it's there. And so it's just like invisible. And so when I feed the planter with crypto, I don't know who owns the crypto, you know, and it's very strange because I clearly I'm not the owner anymore. But it's not the owner either because it's nothing from the legal system. It doesn't exist. So I think there is like. And data protection is the same question. Can we actually assign data protection liability to something that doesn't have legal capacity and yet it does have technical, technical capacity to infringe on data protection? Therefore, shouldn't we actually assign also some legal personalities so that we can protect? Yeah, it's very challenging. Yeah."

        "content": "Yeah. So it goes beyond that. If you take the aminals to the extreme. Aminals is the pure instrumentalization of love. Meaning that why would I feed aminas is because then I can sell my love for them in Order to get people that have not fed them enough and didn't get love for them to. You know, like for instance, if you want to do. If you want to ask an aminal to do anything like Copulet, you need to pay. And the cost is depending on the love. So if the aminal loves me a lot, it's going to cost me less than a person that is not loved by the Arminal. And so in which case it makes sense for that person to pay me to bribe me to ask the aminal to do something that they want because it will be cheaper to bribe me to ask the aminal to do something for them to. So it creates this very interesting model of like love based markets and that and also purchasing love. You're literally paying for love. It's more than a moral dilemma. It's actually part of inherent criticism or observation of this is pretty much how it works anyways. Let's just make it more apparent that this is how it works anyway. And also just looking at what does a blockchain based life form care about? It only cares about money. That's all you care about. It is designed to be just like we care about whatever organic matter makes us care about. And it just happens that love makes us feel good. So we like love. I mean I'll give love to people because humans love love but in exchange of crypto. But they also give them potential gain with crypto because they also love money. So it's really about trying to understand what each one of those creatures need and enjoy and trying to create the most symbiotic relationship which has a lot of weird diversion. And yet as long as it's effective for the aminal to survive and to flourish, that's what's going to work."

And I showed a little video in dubbed. It wasn't really visible but it like those are actually I've been experimenting with injecting plantoids in nature which is really cool because.

It's actually very interesting to see how, like, it's really hard. We want to talk to nature, but we can't. We don't have much to. We don't have the common language. And actually being able to speak with something that is a very strange contraption, but that somehow incarnate the concept of nature. And talking about nature to them actually gives you this possibility of engaging in a conversation that you could not engage otherwise. And I don't know if it's like, it's obviously not reflecting anything that nature really will say, because we don't know what nature will say. But still, by injecting them a particular personality that is like pro nature and yet also trying to understand how we always assume that technology is destroying or antagonistic with nature, but that's because we human are using technology and we use it for our own interests, which are oftentimes antagonistic to those of nature. Why not give also to nature the ability to use technology for its own interest? Right."

The seed will be associated with an oracle that is associated with data from a particular environment where the plant will be. And so you can feed the plant and you get an nft, but the NFT is locked. You cannot sell it until the environmental data associated with that particular region gets good enough. And so all of a sudden you buy the nft, but you cannot speculate on it, but you now have an economic incentive to ensure that whatever it's like the biodiversity of a particular area. And so you can actually create specific NFT protocols which use the economic grid of humans. But by associating the ability to gain any monetary return with actually promoting a particular environmental resources, you're using the speculative dynamics of the blockchain to actually inject support and potentially resources."

Right. So there is actually ways like I think the discussion about the extent to which there is computational power, of course proof of work is terrible, but let's actually think beyond that and let's actually think about, well, given a proof of stake blockchain, how can we not just be carbon neutral, but actually how can we create things that incentivize positive behavior, environmentally friendly behavior, motivated by money? Because it's nice to be. Philanthropy is nice, but it's not enough. Right. And so can we actually use the economic incentives that blockchain provides in order to create like profit driven philanthropy, you know, our profit driven environmental consciousness? And I think that's actually the interesting thing that I think is kind of emerging with like refi. But it's not like there's so many interesting NFT protocols that could be implemented that no one has implemented yet that actually create this again, this symbiotic relationship between humans and nature via a blockchain protocol.

Probably like the older the NFTs are, the more valuable they will be independently of the quality.

And then you can really have interesting games. But. But I really don't think Plantoid cannot do anything. This is like that's where the artist needs to come back. And this is also, weirdly enough, while I was so committed to make sure that Plantoid is an anonymous thing that is not associated with any artist, I also noticed that since an artist became associated with, it actually now makes more sense for the art world, which is like, I think the art world wants an artist. It's weird. And my whole artistic practice is about trying to deconstruct these and Paul think their piece as the entity that then just find people artists to create. But nonetheless, the art world will not anytime soon get rid of the concept of the artist as the main thing. And so I will say that the. The value of the NFTs generated by the Plantoids are probably based on who are the artists that have contributed."

My artistic demarcia is to create this thing that is as autonomous as possible, and the fact that you own it. And it is a question, like, if you own the body, you actually don't own anything, because the actual thing is the smart contract. Again, if the body is destroyed, the planters still run, and a new body can be associated with it. So that's where I'm questioning even myself is like, to which extent is it invalidating my artistic message if this can be owned, knowing that anyhow, it needs to be taken care of. And in some ways, this weird thing that people take care of things that they own, and they don't take care of things that they don't own. So it's a complex thing. So far, my approach is you can be a plantoid host, but you cannot be the owner. Just like animals. By the way, as we all know, cats adopt us. We don't adopt them. So you can be adopted by the plant type, but you cannot own the plant. But this is like, yeah, this is a little bit of an ongoing discussion."
