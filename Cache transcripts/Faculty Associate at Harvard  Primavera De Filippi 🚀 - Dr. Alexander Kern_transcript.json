        "content": "Yeah, I mean, I'm mostly like, I've been a researcher and looking at all the legal questions of digital technologies and mostly like decentralized technologies and basically like back in 2013, I started focusing a lot on the question of Bitcoin. And then, and then 2014, etc. With like a lot of very interesting legal questions. I started delving a little bit more into that and pretty much like focusing all of my research on those questions. And initially it was mostly like the regulatory and legal issue that those technologies are raising. But then I moved more into like the question of governance and trustless versus trust and the extent to which blockchain technology can be used both as a way of creating those trustless systems that can be used to bypass existing institutions, but also increasingly they also can be used as tools that provide technological guarantees that then can be adopted by existing public or private institutions in order to enhance the transparency, the accountability, the predictability and the confidence in the operation of those institutions so as to enable the re establishment of trust relationships. So it's kind of like there's this dual phase of blockchain technology in which on the one hand it's like disruptive technology that is replacing our bypassing institution, but at the same time, and we are seeing it, that it's increasingly being adopted by companies, by governments, etc. In order to actually further their own interests and operations. So yeah, my research now is also a lot about this kind of like governance of the technology. Like how can we actually govern this new decentralized transnational autonomous technologies, but also governance by the technology, Meaning to which extent the adoption of blockchain technology can actually enable new governance structures that increase confidence and trust."

        "content": "I mean, definitely could be improved, I think. But yeah, I think we have seen already attempts at least at creating decentralized investment funds and so far of course, most of them have failed. And I think that's where the interesting aspect comes about, which is attempting to completely disintermediate. Venture capitalism, of course has its own issues because you know, there's like some kind of expertise that is necessary and things like this. At the same time there is a lot of opportunities which today, you know, because of the nature of venture capitalism, like playing with other people's money and taste these amount of risks that can be taken and there is a lot of opportunities. And I think the initial coin offering and token sale model has shown that, which is. Well, actually there are new mechanisms that are emerging and to which extent do people still need to rely on those venture capital lease as intermediaries actors when it is becoming increasingly possible and easy to directly invest in a more crowdfunding way into a lot of those initiatives. And also there is this question between equity and tokens where when we think in the traditional VC model it's oftentimes you buy equity in a startup and then you need to somehow in order to recoup your investment, you need to wait for the next investment round so that you can potentially sell your shares. So on the one hand it creates this kind of reduced liquidity, so there is specific point and events in which it becomes possible to recap the investment. But also it creates an incentive for encouraging those startups to actually rely on this kind of scaling model, which is well, you need to invest, invest, invest, invest a lot of money in order to scale to get a lot of traction and adoption and then second round raise again money and scale more and scale more. And so there is this kind of tendency of pushing the startups towards this model of operations because of the inherent liquidity model. And when you invest in tokens, it's interesting because the liquidity is actually immediately there. There is no need of waiting for different investment rounds. And so the motivation and the incentives can also be different. And so one thing that I think is very interesting is to see like of course I think there is still an important role to be played by venture capitalists. And I think seeing venture capitalists also entering into the field of ICOs and token sale is, is interesting and is fundamental. But what's interesting is also to see whether the emergence of those alternative model of investment can trigger different approaches towards touching specific teams and specific initiatives and specific projects in operating not necessarily in the, you know, scale, scale, scale and be profitable only at the end at model perhaps where profitability can come in much earlier and in which it's not necessarily the case that you want to just like scale up before starting to actually make any type of profit because there will be investment coming in all the time, but the investment comes at the beginning and then you just deliver the product."

        "role": "user",
        "content": "And how do you see it about like the transparency? I mean why you'd normally use the venture capitalist or why you have venture capitalist is that you have big institutional investors endowments which don't have the capabilities of like investing directly in startups because they don't have the manpower, they cannot do the due diligence, the research themselves. And on the other hand, like you have like kind of those retail investors, more like the smaller type of investors, they have the troubles like also saying that they don't know where is a new startup raising some money in the world. And also portfolio diversification might be another issue. Why people are investing in funds, trusting in fund managers to distribute the money in a proper way. Now when a company does, for example, an ico, as you said, they will raise the money only at the beginning. Is there a way to, in your opinion, help to make the market a little bit more transparent and allow those investor classes which normally would like to invest in those startups get better access to it?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, I mean, I think that's what the SEC and regression comes about. But yeah, I think to me the thing that is kind of missing in the model of like the current ICO is also because of the inherent speculative model that is associated with those tokens. Basically most of the investment are not necessarily done because one necessarily believe in the future of the project, but it's mostly because they think that other people might consider this to be a good speculative investment. So the question of transparency is secondary because those tokens are actually all that matters. And sometimes you have a token that actually just becomes very valuable, but there is no real product behind. So to me it's more about this type of those mechanism. Those tokens that have been done so far are inherently designed around the speculation of the token, which is also to some extent self defeating because if the value of the token raised too much, then it's difficult that anyone will actually ever want to spend those tokens in order to benefit from the service, because it's going to be very expensive, given that you could just hold the token and then sell it later. So there is this strange dynamics in which yes, of course it's great and it can actually trigger a lot of initial investment to build the project. But then if it's too successful, if the tokens become too valuable because of the expectation that the project will succeed, then it becomes harder for the project to succeed as an actual project because people will just hold those tokens. And so it creates a kind of attention between the usability and the accessibility of the project and the actual value of the tokens. And to some extent, if the value of the token is lower, then more people will be able to actually use that service. So that's where there is this kind of tension which does not exist in traditional equity in which you just purchase the shares of a company and then that doesn't dictate the cost of accessing the service of this company. So there is some interesting dilemmas, but those are not necessarily. I think those are things that happen today because I think most of the token sale and the ICOs have been designed mostly in mind with speculative dynamics. Doesn't mean that you cannot actually design some alternative models for sale that will actually solve some of those problems. And inherently that means not having a fixed supply of this tokens. And then as more people want to use the service, then most likely you will also need to issue more tokens so that there is actually a constant availability of those things. And at the same time that means that it has less of investment and speculative potential, but at least the project itself actually can have higher chances of succeeding. So I mean, there is this duality that needs to be resolved. And so far I think it has not been properly addressed. And so most of those ICO type form of investment are actually still inherently on the speculation of the token as opposed to focusing on the project and the likelihood of success of the project."

      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Okay, and how does it work? I think like a lot of people are not clear about it once that ICO has been happening, but the company needs at a later stage another inflow of capital. Would that be the same as what you just explained, that the company can issue then another amount of tokens basically kind of diluting their own tokens or."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "How ideally, I mean that shouldn't be the case, right? Like they commit that there is a fixed supply. So I mean most of the current model of ICO there is like there is a commitment on the part of the token issuer that they will not issue more tokens. But that's the problem is that and people are purchasing, are investing in the token because they have an expectation that the value will go up when the project becomes successful and people actually want to access the services. But that creates a conflict, that creates the tension between the actual usability of the project of itself. So yeah, like currently the current model are not addressing this issue, which is a problem. And yeah, I think there is still a lot of room for innovating into designing better or alternative models of that actually allows for potentially issuing more token if necessary because of the demand that has increased. And then how do you accommodate that with the expectation of the investor that are specializing the token? So you need to present at the outset that there is this type of maybe algorithmical issuance in which depending on the, depending on the amount of tokens that are being spent on the service, depending on the market value, etc. Then you can start issuing your token algorithmically because of course you don't want to just leave arbitrary decision making to the token issue that they could just issue anything at any time. Because then there is absolutely no guarantees for the investor that's they will not just like flood the market with tokens. Right."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "That's really a dilemma for the investor because the investor wants that the company is sufficiently funded in order to scale the business and grow the business. So like, I mean the traditional VC model is built on that. What you before said, like you have like later funding rounds when new money is coming in and like traditionally works with shares, so new shares will be given out, you're diluting but like you get a higher valuation of the company. Now with the tokens, the problem is you raise at the beginning, maybe more funding where people speculate higher on it. But what happens then really if the company is not becoming as successful as it seems to be, or they run out of money for whatever reason? So that is really the dilemma I'm seeing here. Do you see a way to overcome that dilemma?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The dilemma of like how do you get additional funding already?"
      },

        "role": "user",
        "content": "Yeah, exactly."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Again, I think it's a matter of designing it in the beginning. And of course there will always be, there will always be a trade off to be designed between how much of speculative potential are you promising to the investors and how much do you actually want a successful project that can actually earn profits and then redistribute those profits. Right. So it's kind of like to me there is like there is like a life cycle and at the beginning you can use the tokens as a way of actually collecting the initial investment. But then once the project becomes operative and people start actually using it and people start spending those tokens in order to access the product or the services that are provided by that particular initiative, then profits can be made. And so instead of just speculating on reselling the tokens on the secondary market, you can actually acquire a share of the profits because you hold those tokens. But there needs to be a way in which users can acquire token at a price that is not exorbitant. Otherwise literally you just created a financial instrument. But that's not like if the concept of the token is a utility token, which is a token that you spend in order to access the services or the product of this blockchain based initiative, then the token cannot be a purely speculative instrument because otherwise no one will ever spend those tokens. So there needs to be a process by which the token can change. And I mean that's happened all the time. Initially it can be an investment token and then it can become utility token and then potentially could even become like a payment token. Right? But this all needs to be defined ex ante because this is not, it's not acceptable. Like no one will trust an initiative in which the founder can just decide at any moment how they want to modify the quantity of token that is being issued and the way in which profits are like dividends are being distributed to the token holder, etc. It has to be all defined in advance. And the point is that investor needs to understand that I'm investing in a project in which I want the success of the project. And while at the beginning you can invest in those tokens and expect some kind of return on investment because of the secondary market, there is a point once the project is operative that the profits will no longer derive from the speculation from the added value that you get by just selling those tokens, but by the profits. And that means that all of student investor actually want the project to make profits and not just to speculate on the tokens. So it's about how do you also align the incentives between the investors and the project? And I think it's the same thing with venture capitalists, which is if there needs to be an alignment and it's important that the investor wants the company to be profitable and not just the company to scale up in order to raise more money. And then you just keep raising, raising, raising ever. But now no one is actually focused on the profitability, right? So in that sense, I guess both the blockchain space and the traditional venture capitalists, they have this same question of like, of course it's very nice to just invest and expect these in the value of the investment by the mere fact of the secondary market. But then the project also needs to be profitable and there needs to be an incentive for the investor to want this type of profitability."

        "content": "May I ask a quick last question? Did in your opinion then venture Capital fail, by the way, how they have been looking at it. And second part of that question, could you see a venture capital fund being designed purely on the blockchain with for example, investment tokens or like a similar setup as you mentioned for the startups?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I mean again, there have been a few of those initiatives that have been creating decentralized investment funds on the blockchain. To me, again, it's difficult to imagine a successful one that only operates if you give like to me, there is a lot of value in an investment fund which is like the people managing the money, the people that are actually spending a lot of time, a lot of expertise in studying the market, in understanding the project, et cetera. And it's not because one person has a lot of money that this person is necessarily the most skilled and the most capable of knowing what to invest in funds. And so by creating a pure decentralized organization type of investment funds, then that means that it's the investors that are actually making the decision. It's not necessarily the best decision. So yes, I think you definitely can have blockchain mediated investment funds where many of the decision in order to increase the transparency, in order to increase their accountability, etc. That many of the decisions and the operations are mediated by a blockchain infrastructure, but without nonetheless removing the figures of the managers which are experts in the field and which might have a greater decision making than just the investor. That means that if I invest in these funds it's because actually I have money, but I don't really know what to do with it and I'm delegating the decision making to people that know better. So to me it's not a matter of like can we do it or can we not do it with a blockchain infrastructure. This is just a technology. The question is more what is the right governance structure that we want to implement on top of this decentralized technology in order to ensure that we benefit from those technological guarantees that blockchain technology provides, while also benefiting from all the legacy expertise of the people that are really experts in the field and the people that will manage that money."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Yeah, I mean, I think like basically for me there is two different trajectories that can emerge and are emerging. One is those like fully decentralized autonomous blockchain based organizations which are trying to kind of not necessarily replicate but create those type of decentralized investment funds with their own completely decentralized model of meritocratic or plutocratic governance structure. And then there is another space and I think this one is not so much being explored and that would be like an interesting place to explore, which is actually just injecting some of the blockchain technological guarantees within existing investment funds just in order to provide greater guarantees and greater transparency so that the investor can feel more comfortable and are more likely to trust those institutions. And that doesn't require reinventing the whole governance. It just requires codifying a lot of the procedures and the operation that can be codified onto this infrastructure while maintaining all the off chain governance structure as it is. But that is constrained by those bits that have been codified. And I think that's perhaps where the more traditional VC firms could move towards. It's not like, well, let's decentralize everything. It's just like let's figure out which bits of this organization can be codified into this infrastructure and how this can contribute to increasing the confidence and the transparency in the operation of the film."
