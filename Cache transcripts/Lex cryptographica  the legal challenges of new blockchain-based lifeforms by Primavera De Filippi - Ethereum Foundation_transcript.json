So first of all, a blockchain is a decentralized database that operates on top of a peer to peer network. And just like the Internet, those networks are global and transnational and do not generally account for national boundaries."

        "content": "because a blockchain is replicated on the computer of every network node, then it is highly resilient. And because all nodes actually follow the exact same protocols, then it is virtually impossible to unilaterally modify or tamper with the data recorded on this decentralized database."

But because every transaction is actually cryptographically signed with the private key of the party executing it, then no one can also later deny actually having effected and executed this transaction."

        "content": "When we're thinking about regulation, then how does this actually differ from traditional software code? So on the Internet we have this notion of lex informatica, which essentially just means that code is increasingly being used as a means to regulate behaviors. And so code is law because code assumes the same functionality as the law, even though of course this code actually remains under the control of specific online operators, which are themselves subject to the rule of the law."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The blockchain code is also being used as a means to regulate behavior. The difference is that this time, because of the specificity and the fundamental characteristics of a blockchain, then blockchain based code can actually be designed to largely ignore the traditional rule of law. And so the only law that actually matters on those systems is the code."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "This has two important implications. The first one is that it reduces the need for intermediaries and trusted authorities, because it actually shifts the, the notion of trust away from those centralized operators and towards the underlying technology. And so as long as we can actually trust the technology, then we no longer need to trust, in theory, anyone else."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "the other one is that this actually creates new opportunities for increasing the automation and the autonomy of those blockchain based systems, because once they have been deployed on the blockchain, then those systems no longer need or hit their creators. And they can actually be designed to operate autonomously and independently of the original will of the parties deploying it."

        "content": "this obviously can create some potential conflicts between the rule of code and the rule of law. And so what is actually really interesting to explore is what is the interplay between those two types of regulation, regulation by law and regulation by code, and whether one can actually overtake the other."

And as soon as the opportunities of the Internet actually began to be understood by new and established market players, then the market dynamics actually kicked in, and the architecture of the Internet slowly started to change, becoming this increasingly concentrated system which is today controlled by a few incumbents."

        "content": "in fact, after the initial fear of crypto anarchy faded away, it soon became quite clear that it's not too hard to regulate the Internet, because even though direct regulation by law can be difficult, because code is increasingly replacing the law as a means of regulation, then governments can actually use the law in order to regulate the code, by actually exerting pressure on those online operators, which are indeed operating that code."

        "content": "the problem here is that with a blockchain, we actually have lost one of the most effective means of regulation, which are the intermediary operator. And if there is no intermediary operator, then it becomes much harder to leverage the traditional means of regulation that were available on the Internet, because it actually is no longer so easy to identify what is the actual object of regulation."

        "content": "when talking about the regulation of the cyberspace, people introduced the notion of unregulability in order to highlight the difficulties inherent in the regulation of such a global and transnational network like the Internet. And in the blockchain space, people prefer to refer to those platforms as being illegal in the sense that they operate outside of the pure view of the law. And so the idea is that a blockchain based system creates its own separate technical framework that cannot be touched or affected by the law."

So traditional property rights are defined by the law, and therefore they can only be taken away by the law.
