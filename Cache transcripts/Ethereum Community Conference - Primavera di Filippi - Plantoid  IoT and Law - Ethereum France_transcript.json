And then whenever it gets fed, it just show appreciation. I'm just going to give it a little bit of funds. And then usually it should say thank you.

But ideally we will create very different system of governance. So now we're going to experiment with the Daostag team to actually create new mechanism to have the holographic consensus system and so forth. And so the plantoids that are the most interesting, either physically or intellectually, will be the one that collect the more money, and therefore will be the one that will be able to reproduce more into those different species or branches of a plantoid."

And so this creates a positive incentive for the artists not just to collect the money and make the plantoid as simply as possible, but to actually try and make the most interesting one and to promote it and to actually encourage the reproduction thereof. Because the more this plantoid will reproduce, then the more the artist will eventually be able to collect funds through the plantoid and through all the descendancy of it."

So the object of the contract obviously is the creation of a new plantoid, the parties. It's kind of complicated because obviously in the existing legal framework, the plantoid cannot really be a party to the contract. And so who is actually the person that is hiring the artist to make the new plantoid? Is it the original authority that actually created the initial plan, so in that case it will be me, or is it the new artist that actually created the next plant down the line?"

So what happen if the plantoid is hiring someone to create a new version of itself according to specific criteria which are codified within the DNA code? But obviously the smart contract cannot check whether or not the person that will make the descendant of this planet will actually implement the wings. And so what happens if the plantoid is hiring these new artists and the new artist is actually not complying with the requirements of this contract? So is there a breach of contract? And in that case, who is actually entitled to to sue for this breach of contract? So if it was relying on copyright, it will be much easier because basically the copyright holder gets the right to sue. So in this case, it will be me or whoever artist has created the plantoid. But because they are all under a Creative Common License, then it's more difficult to sue anyone just because they copied the design."

Or perhaps is it like the software developer that actually created the smart contract and the smart contract didn't work properly and just bit fire and it was not the right moment and burned someone?

So in the same way as we asked the question, can the plaintiff actually be responsible for hiring someone and therefore enter into a contractual relationship? It requires legal capacity. Or can the plaintiff actually sue if someone is not complying with the legal requirement? But as well, can the planetoid be sued itself if it's actually causing a tort? And so there is a lot of thinking going on, especially with AI, but that I think can be quite easily related as well with blockchain based system, which is, can we actually provide this form of legal personhood or legal capacity to those autonomous device so that on the one hand they can actually own assets and properties, and on the other hand they also can take part into contractual agreements so they can hold legal rights and obligations and possibly enter into legal proceedings."

The question is that in the real world we have property rights which are actually defined by the law and therefore can be taken away and are enforced through the law. Whereas when we enter into a blockchain based system, we have this new notion of crypto property in which the planet which actually holds those assets is the sole possible owner, because these properties actually defined and therefore enforced by the blockchain. So even assuming that the plaintiff actually could be sued because the legal system will actually recognize this as a legal personhood, then even if a court will say that indeed some of the funds of the plant has to be paid to the person that has been harmed, then there is actually no way for a legal enforcement to be done on the assets of the plantard. Only if the plant actually incorporates within its own smart contract the ability to actually listen to a court, then will those assets be able to be transferred."

So you could design a model by which the people that funded it gets to have a timeshare or that the people that funded it gets to to decide where it's going to be. I mean, you can design pretty much any model. Right now most of the governance, like all the five plantards, have a very, very basic governance structure because I just didn't bother to actually make it more sophisticated. But that's exactly the question is today.

And you can have like for instance, you could have a plantoid that is more of like a capitalistic plantoid where if I'm investing in the plantoid, I might get a return on investment. And then to actually see over time what are the different governance that are the most appealing to the environment. So how do you design the plant that is the most fit and what are the things that the human beings like? The most. And therefore we'd be willing to. And if this involves that the funder needs to be able to host the plantoid, that might be one thing, but we don't know.

And so what I'm exploring is not something I'm endorsing, it's something I'm just looking at. What are the various possibilities is how do we actually design this bridge?

You know, like the reason we created a corporation is because we want to hear create new economic agents and because individual actually want to protect themselves from liability. So as you create autonomous blockchain based agents and you want to interact with those as economic agents, then if there is no legal incorporation, so if I don't create an actual company or a foundation or something that is associated with that, then you need to come up with more sophisticated mechanisms."

Like basically, it's an artist who's being hired to make a piece of art and he's being hired by several persons who don't know each other. They are anonymous to each other. So they pay the artist and the artist creates something. So can it be considered as a common ownership with the owner being anonymous to each other, which is something that wouldn't be unknown in the ordinary landscape? I mean, listed companies, for instance, the owners are the shoulders. They don't know each other and still they do."

        "content": "Yes. I mean, one way in which you can interpret this is that the founders of the Plantode are actually emergently creating general partnership. And as a general partnership, they are hiring an artist to actually create this. So that's a possibility. The thing is that there is no defined legal answer to that. There are many ways in which if there is an actual problem, then the court will actually always try and identify who's the closest available person. And that's going to be the person that is either the person that is liable or the person that is responsible or potentially contractually related with the new artist. So the question though is like, if we actually want to design something, then what is the technological structures that we can devise in order for this to be the closest possible to the goal of having this thing being this autonomous being. Hi."

But for example, the governance structure that you have to select the artist, I guess that if that also is up to growing and to changing over time, then I would think that probably the way that it changes is also through the current governance system. So basically the next plantoid, it will be chosen, the artifacts will be chosen by the community. But I guess also the governance structure to select its child is also decided by that current community. Right?"

        "content": "Well, so every plantoid will be created by a particular team or artist, and then this team will design both the physical design and the governance design, knowing that it will have to abide by the genetic criteria that has been put before. So, for instance, one of the plantoid is at charity, for instance. So it means that half of its fund is actually donating into something which has been codified as part of the DNA of the governance. So all the children of these plantoid will have to implement the same governance structure. But the governance structure is part of the proposal, potentially. So the people that are choosing, they might actually be encouraged to select one proposal rather than the other. But because it's appealing physically, but also because it's appealing from a governance perspective."

So at the moment there is no solution to that because again, the governance system is super stupid. But ideally, for instance, it will be like milestone based. So the planet will not just give all the money all at once, but will provide a specific amount of money and then wait for some milestones. And then when people approve that the milestone has been achieved, then the next installment will get given. So again, this is something that needs to be built into the smart contract and we need to figure out what's the best way to do that. Thank you. It."
