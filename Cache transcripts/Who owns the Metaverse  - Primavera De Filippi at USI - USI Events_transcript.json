You may have heard about it, maybe you participated in it, it's Second Life. It's one of the first attempts at creating a virtual world, a metaverse, from the beginning of the 2000s, so well before virtual reality became popularized like today. And so Second Life presents itself as a new virtual space where people can have fun, where people can meet, where we can work and potentially also do business.

It's a game that had a lot of success, that lasted for 11 years, and one day, it was terminated because, precisely, Facebook decided to no longer support the technology on which it relied, which therefore caused the death of this metaverse. Another metaverse maybe a bit more interesting, it's Minecraft, which looks like this. Minecraft is a platform that allows users to create their own virtual world by aggregating thousands or millions of small blocks, one with the others, a bit like Lego. in order to create or co-create, because it's a collaborative effort, universes, virtual infrastructures, landscapes. Really, there's no limit, it's imagination and the limit. It's work that's done collectively with all the users who are connected to the same networks. Minecraft had a lot of success, notably among kids, and it was bought a few years ago by Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars."

And so, it's also a game, a platform that had a record growth, notably since the beginning of the pandemic, very popular, especially among kids and that has more or less 45 million users connected every day and a stock market valuation of more than 45 billion dollars. And then, of course, we don't want to escape it. There's Facebook, which by the way was recently renamed to META, in honor of the Metaverse. And so, a few months ago, Mark Zuckerberg announced to us his vision concerning the future of Facebook, which will progressively develop into an immersive networking platform in the Metaverse, notably thanks to virtual reality.

        "content": "just a remark because it's still interesting every time they show us visions of the metaverse and then in the end we end up with people sitting at their desk behind flat screens typing on their virtual keyboard. So often metaverses that despite everything look a little too much like our physical world. In any case, I'm not going to give you a tour of all corners of the metaverse, but now that we've already started to discover some of these virtual worlds that build the metaverse, I'd like to return to this original question of \"what is the metaverse?\" And so it's difficult because there's a lot of confusion, there's also a lot of language abuse, and that makes it quite difficult to understand what the distinction is between all these terms such as the metaverse, the internet, cyberspace, etc. And it's a bit like a few years ago where suddenly, all online servers became cloud computing. And then, all our software progressively transforms into artificial intelligences. Our databases become blockchains. And once again, marketing has played its game well. And today, most platforms on the Internet, most apps are now part of the metaverse. But if we still try to think, to try to analyze what are the distinctive characteristics of the metaverse that allow us to distinguish the metaverse from other applications on the internet, I'll propose a few, don't hesitate if you have additional ideas. First, the metaverse is a meta space, that is to say it exists beyond our reality. It's a persistent space, that never turns off and continues to exist even when we're not connected. It's an immersive space that will engulf users and brings them into a shared reality. It's of course an interactive space that feeds on interactions and contributions from users. And, and this is very important, it's an interconnected space that interfaces therefore through several realities, both physical and virtual. So these are interesting characteristics, they're quite similar to those you proposed. The problem is that in fact, in reality, most of these descriptions apply very well also to the majority of online applications with which we interact today on the Internet."

      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "what really is this discriminating element that allows us to distinguish what the metaverse is and what is only the Internet as we already know it? Well, the Internet, or cyberspace, as we called it in the 90s, came with a promise of deterritorialization, with the possibility of communicating in real time with people from the four corners of the world. And this promise came accompanied by a process of dematerialization and despatialization. That is to say we interact with people behind our flat screens without having the possibility to locate our interlocutors in space and without being able therefore to feel their presence in our surroundings. And so, despite its name, cyberspace is not really a space. And the metaverse will therefore reintroduce this notion of spatiality. Both because it will integrate within our existing realities, with notably augmented reality, but also because it allows the creation of new digital spaces that will reintegrate the notion of distance, movement and therefore spatiality, although these terminologies don't need to share the same prerogatives as they do in the physical world. It's therefore thus that the metaverse makes us dream, with the promise of freeing us from the physical constraints of body and matter, while maintaining the possibility of moving and therefore also of flying or teleporting, which are things that are simply inconceivable on the Internet, where all we can do is connect or disconnect from a server."

        "content": "How does this reintroduction of spatiality affect concepts like territory and property in the metaverse?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "that also means that suddenly, the notion of territory reappears. Both from a geographical point of view, so with the possibility of locating oneself on a territory, the possibility of moving and transporting oneself from one place to another, but also from a legal and political point of view, with the possibility of delimiting these territories into parcels and then appropriating these parcels to be able to exploit them exclusively. And of course, land speculation hasn't missed this opportunity. Starting in the 2000s with the sale of a first virtual land on Second Life for 50,000 dollars, which at the time seemed an exorbitant price, to come just a few months ago with the sale of virtual land on Decentraland for more than 1 million dollars, which suddenly no longer seemed so exorbitant. The particularity of all this is that the value of these lands depends on their location. That is to say that the more the lands are located in a central place, the more they will be able to generate traffic, as in the physical world, and therefore the more they will be profitable and therefore the more they will be in demand. So, you may see the irony, while we're creating virtual worlds that try to replicate and simulate the same limitations and constraints of the physical world. virtual worlds that are not only limited in space, while digital space is theoretically infinite, but also virtual worlds that are flat, because that allows us to discriminate economically between lands that are located right in the middle of the metaverse and that will therefore have a much higher market value, and lands that are located at the four corners of the virtual world, which will therefore be much less in demand."

And although it's still a relatively embryonic economy, there are already enormous sums of money transiting every day on the metaverse. There are also of course new businesses that are establishing themselves on this new terrain. So what are the businesses? First of all, we have the real estate business, since if we can now sell virtual lands for several hundred thousand dollars or millions of dollars, there's also quite a bit of money to be made helping people find good real estate deals. And so on one side, we have young startups that specialize in the metaverse and that will therefore help their clients buy or rent virtual lands on a variety of virtual worlds. And then, we also have existing real estate agencies that will add the metaverse to their portfolio to allow their clients to invest in virtual lands. to build virtual infrastructures on these lands in order to then be able to resell these lands for more or, why not, in order to rent these virtual infrastructures to those who would need to benefit from them."

It was a huge success, it had more than 10 million connected users and a profit of more than 20 million dollars. Which is interesting because it's 20 times more than the average profit Travis Scott makes when he does a concert in the physical world. And then we have Lil Nas, another rapper, who chose the Roblox platform for his concerts. It was also a great success with more than 30 million users connected over four performances of his show and profits of several tens of millions of dollars. They didn't reveal the exact figure and these profits were generated not only with the sale of tickets for the concert, but also with the sale of merchandise, so t-shirts or accessories for the avatars of all the people who virtually attended this concert. And then we have perhaps the greatest genius regarding marketing on the metaverse, another American rapper, Snoop Dogg, who bought a huge plot of land on the Sandbox metaverse. where he built this huge villa, where he organizes concerts, but also VIP private parties, whose tickets cost much more. And so, an interesting anecdote is that as soon as he bought this land and built the villa, suddenly, the price of adjacent lands exploded, since, obviously, everyone wants to be Snoop Dogg's neighbor. and Snoop Dogg also created a partnership with Sandbox to create avatars in his image that people will be able to buy in order to be able to embody Snoop Dogg in the metaverse as well as the development of accessories, personal objects such as his clothes or his dogs or his car collection which are all put on sale on the Sandbox platform."

Basically, today, we have lots of people, especially teenagers, who spend hundreds, sometimes thousands of euros to dress their avatars or to buy them accessories. There's even someone who spent 4,000 dollars to buy a Gucci bag on Roblox, knowing that the same bag sold in a Gucci boutique in the physical world only cost 3,500 dollars.

And yet, we all know today who controls the Internet. And I have to add Elon Musk to this slide. And so, what guarantees us today that the metaverse won't have the same fate as the Internet with the emergence of dominant platforms that will control the majority of the infrastructure and therefore the majority of traffic on the metaverse?"

All we have is a variety of virtual worlds, of more or less large size, which are completely disconnected from each other, and which are all competing to become the metaverse. And so, depending on your age, this will remind you of something. I don't know if it's good or bad memories, but at the beginning of the 90s, when the Internet was still taking its first steps, there were companies such as CompuServe or America Online that provided Internet access within a closed territory controlled exclusively by its operators, and therefore which didn't benefit from all the opportunities for innovation and interoperability that the Internet provides us today. And in fact, when we look at the metaverse domain, we realize that the situation isn't very different. That is to say that we have today a small number of actors who position themselves as pioneers, as leaders of the metaverse. And although no one can effectively own the metaverse, these operators hold and exercise absolute control over the virtual worlds they govern and therefore also over all the digital resources that transit within these platforms."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Basically, this means that everything you buy on the metaverse, you don't own it, it's the platforms that own it. This means that when I buy a Gucci bag on Roblox, in reality, I don't own much. First, because there's no guarantee that the partnership between Gucci and Roblox will continue, so I could suddenly lose my bag. Second, because there's no interoperability, I can't transfer my bag to another virtual world. And so the day I'm tired of playing Roblox, which won't take long, well, tough luck, I'll have to abandon all my digital possessions. So this raises some quite interesting questions about what is the future of all these investments on the metaverse. Because either we have to choose a platform. So if I think Roblox will become the dominant metaverse platform rather than Fortnite or Sandbox, then I'll invest in this platform, I'll buy land, I'll build infrastructure, I'll launch businesses, I'll buy lots of accessories for my avatars, and that's what people are doing today. But if I don't know which is this dominant platform, maybe this dominant platform doesn't exist yet and maybe it will never exist. In this case, I want to be able to invest in resources that have their own existence, that is to say they exist independently of the platform on which I'll buy them."

        "content": "indeed, if we think about what is the greatest added value that the Internet has brought us, it's the interoperability of communications, the ability to transfer messages from one platform to another in seconds. And so, for the vision of the metaverse as we conceptualize it today to be realized, the metaverse must also provide us with a certain degree of interoperability. Interoperability in the case of the metaverse doesn't just imply the interoperability of messages, but also the possibility of transferring digital resources from one end of the metaverse to the other. And the missing link for this materialization to take place correctly is the notion of virtual property, that is to say the possibility of acquiring digital resources in such a way that they will be legally recognized as such, and this independently of the will of the platforms on which they reside. The problem is that any form of property necessarily implies a certain degree of scarcity. Physical objects are rare due to their materiality. We can't reproduce them easily. But in digital, this scarcity doesn't exist since digital files can be reproduced infinitely. And so, we rely on copyright, on intellectual property to create a system of artificial scarcity that is therefore legally guided. And yet, today, we have a new technology that allows us to create scarcity in the digital domain that is not of an artificial nature, but is of a technical or virtual nature."

That is to say that although a photo can be printed indefinitely, the artist can decide to create limited copies, and so each print will be numbered and signed by the artist, and that's what will determine its value on the market. And so today, thanks to blockchain, we can do the same thing with digital objects. Blockchain indeed allows us to create digital resources that are rare, that is to say they cannot be reproduced. So, you all know blockchain in relation to Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency that was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. And so, although it's a cryptocurrency, so a virtual currency, blockchain makes it so that any attempt to reproduce or multiply Bitcoins is apparently impossible. The same principles that apply to cryptocurrencies also possibly apply to any form of digital resource for which it is fundamental to guarantee rarity and authenticity. And so blockchain relies on cryptography systems, on signatures and electronic certificates, in order to guarantee the uniqueness of digital resources that are stored on this database and that will therefore be able to be transferred freely, peer-to-peer, in complete serenity, without fear that they will be reproduced in an unauthorized way."

While these resources have distinctive characteristics that give them their own identity. They are therefore unique and therefore non-interchangeable. And this is what we call in blockchain jargon, NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens. These new technologies, these new opportunities are used today notably by digital artists who now have the possibility, for the first time in history, to create unique and authentic copies of their digital works that, despite their immateriality, will not be able to be reproduced. And since the art world has shown interest in these new opportunities, the price of these NFTs has gone to the stars up to reaching several hundred million dollars for the purchase of a small animation stored on the blockchain."

Because what they're selling is no longer the intellectual property on the work of the mind, but only the digital copy of these works. And so it's the same as when I buy a book, I'm not going to acquire property rights on the content of the book, but only a property right on the physical copy that I bought. So we notice how there are different layers of scarcity that apply in fact to the same work. So at the very top we have the work of the mind which is subject only to a form of artificial scarcity introduced by copyright. This work can then be incorporated within a digital file which itself is not subject to any form of scarcity since it can be reproduced freely obviously within the limits of copyright. And then, we now have the possibility of tokenizing the file in order to create a unique copy of this digital file which will therefore be subject to a new form of digital or technical scarcity."

What will the metaverse look like in 10 or 20 years? And although it's quite easy to imagine that the metaverse will guide, will support, will accompany a large part of our social, economic and political interactions, as the Internet has done in recent years, it's more difficult to guess what form this technological revolution will take, because it could head in radically opposite directions. So either we'll see the emergence of a dominant platform, one or several dominant platforms that will establish themselves, like the Metaverse, and that will therefore control the majority of the infrastructure and therefore the majority of digital resources that transit on the Metaverse. And in reality, this isn't very different from what's happening today with GAFAM on the Internet. or we'll see the emergence of an open and decentralized metaverse and this obviously implies a strong degree of interoperability and therefore the development of protocols, standards that will be collectively adopted by several metaverse actors in order to guarantee this interconnectivity. This also implies the adoption of a secure and decentralized database, such as blockchain, which will allow guaranteeing the scarcity and authenticity of resources that are in transition on the metaverse."

And then, we have a new initiative fresh from a few weeks ago, Lamina One, an initiative that is founded by Neal Stephenson, who is a science fiction writer known for being the first to have invented and used the term metaverse in his work Snow Crash, or the virtual samurai in French, published in 1992, and Peter Vessenes, who was one of the co-founders of the Bitcoin Foundation, founded in 2012. And so these two pioneers have partnered for the creation of a new blockchain that is specifically designed to encourage and promote the creation of an open and decentralized metaverse. And so it's thus that, thanks to these recent developments, we may soon be able to immerse ourselves in an increasingly open, interconnected, decentralized metaverse. A metaverse that won't be controlled by Facebook or by Roblox, but that will build itself organically thanks to the interconnection of a multitude of virtual worlds that are interoperable with each other, and whose resources will really belong to us, and therefore whose resources will be able to be transferred freely from one virtual world to another."

Wouldn't the metaverse be a tool, precisely, to forget the problems we don't want to face? by locking ourselves within this virtual or augmented reality that is increasingly disconnected from our material reality. Will the metaverse really succeed in contributing to democratizing access to culture, science and education? Will it allow fostering the creation of new communities, strengthening social bonds and promoting collaboration, a bit like the Internet had led us to think? Or will the metaverse contribute to alienating us even more than we already are, by confining us within this virtual reality, to escape another material reality that no longer suits us, instead of trying to strive to change it and make it evolve?"

The idea that the only way to move forward is to move backward, because in a world where resources are finite, we cannot grow indefinitely. So, to reduce our energy consumption and our ecological footprint, we must reduce our production level. We must accept consuming less and seek prosperity through means other than economic growth. And then, on the other side, we have technosolutionism, the idea that technology is our best ally and that the best way to move forward is to move forward even faster, because in a world in danger, we cannot afford to wait, to slow down. We must, on the contrary, invest even more in technological innovation in order to repair the problems that were caused by previous technologies."

Because if it's true that we absolutely must reduce our consumption level in a world where resources are intrinsically limited, it's also true that it's quite difficult to change mentalities and convince people to change their consumption behavior. And so what if we tried to redirect this consumption towards a world where resources are potentially infinite, so towards the metaverse. The metaverse would then present itself as a new alternative, a form of utopia to which it might be difficult to resist, a world of abundance and prosperity where anyone would have the possibility, if they wanted, to create, consume and own an infinity of resources, as long as they are exclusively digital resources. without excessively encroaching, because there's of course always an energy cost, on our material reality."

        "content": "it's a beautiful vision, it's a beautiful utopia. But obviously, if we look at the way the metaverse is developing today, we realize that we're really very far from heading in this direction. Because if blockchain indeed allows us to emancipate ourselves, to free ourselves from the control and constraints imposed by resources, by centralized metaverse platforms, it's also true that blockchain has introduced a new exacerbated market economy, which has led to a commodification of our digital space and therefore created an economy that feeds on scarcity and exclusivity, where a society of sharing and abundance could effectively exist. And so, we realize how blockchain is actually a double-edged sword. On one side, blockchain allows us to promote an open, decentralized ecosystem, which is not controlled by centralized platforms, but on the contrary, which is interconnected and interoperable and where resources really belong to us and become our virtual properties. On the other side, the resulting market economy will intentionally generate scarcity in order to reinforce speculation dynamics and individual profit. And that's what will therefore prevent us from really taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the metaverse, notably regarding the abundance linked to its immateriality."

Nothing prevents the emergence of new virtual worlds that will also establish themselves in an open and interconnected way, but that won't focus on private property, but rather on creating communities and producing commons. Virtual worlds that will also rely on blockchain, not to generate scarcity, but rather to implement new decentralized, community governance systems, whose goal is not the maximization of individual profit, but rather promoting the general interest and the common good. So, on which of these alternatives do you want to bet? Obviously, it's a rather difficult bet, we can't predict the future. And yet, we're lucky because we're not just passive spectators of the metaverse, we're all actors. We all have the possibility of influencing how the metaverse will develop. And we can do this by choosing which platform we want to connect to, what typologies of resources we want to invest in, and of course, what modality of use we want to promote."
