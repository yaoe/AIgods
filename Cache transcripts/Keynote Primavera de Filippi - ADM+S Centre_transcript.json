And then today we can now finally encapsulate or reference this digital file into a token, into an nft, which will then represent the unique and authentic copy of this file, which is not subject to artificial scarcity in the legal sense of things, but that is subject to this new type of virtual or, or digital scarcity that actually comes from a technical perspective."

And so Amina cannot be owned. There is no way of actually you cannot purchase these NFTs. It's an NFT that exists on the blockchain.

It's not just the copyright in the chair, it's the virtual asset of the chair, which incorporate a copyright. So, similar to something like Ready Player One, Is that why we're taking that too?
